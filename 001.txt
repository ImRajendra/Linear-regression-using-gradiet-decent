    Computing Our Way to Paradise? : The Role of Internet and
    Communication Technologies in Sustainable Consumption and Globalization
*Series:*
    Globalization and the Environment
*Authors:*
    Robert Rattle
*Publication Information:*
    Lanham, Md : AltaMira Press. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Rattle's new book challenges key assumptions concerning the role of
    Internet and communication technologies (ICTs) in globalization
    processes. The author argues that while globalization is predicated
    upon a strong, extensive, and interconnected global ICT network of
    products, processes, and services, the real environmental and health
    benefits remain far from certain. ICTs have been promoted as the
    next economic wave with the potential to generate jobs, wealth, and
    prosperity to surpass that of the industrial era. It is assumed the
    environmental impacts will be negligible or even beneficial in this
    shift towards a service economy. Rattle investigates these current
    and expected trends in ICTs and their potential contribution to
    sustainable development. His book is an indispensable overview for
    researchers and instructors in globalization, Internet communication
    technologies, and environmental anthropology or sociology, as well
    as a resource for policy makers in environmental protection,
    sustainable development, sustainable consumption, and the social
    role of science and technology.

    System Innovation for Sustainability 4 : Case Studies in Sustainable
    Consumption and Production — Energy Use and the Built Environment
*Series:*
    System Innovation for Sustainability, Vol. 4
*Authors:*
    Saadi Lahlou
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The EU-funded project'Sustainable Consumption Research
    Exchanges'(SCORE!) consists of around 200 experts in the field of
    sustainable innovation and sustainable consumption. The SCORE!
    philosophy is that innovation in SCP policy can be achieved only if
    experts that understand business development, (sustainable) solution
    design, consumer behaviour and system innovation policy work
    together in shaping it. Sustainable technology design can be
    effective only if business can profitably make the products and
    consumers are attracted to them. To understand how this might
    effectively happen, the expertise of systems thinkers must be added
    to the mix. The publication in 2008 of System Innovation for
    Sustainability 1 was the first result of a unique positive
    confrontation between experts from all four communities. It examined
    what SCP is and what it could be, provided a state-of-the-art review
    on the governance of change in SCP policy and looked at the
    strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. System Innovation
    for Sustainability 4 is the third of three books of case studies
    covering respectively the three key consumption areas of mobility,
    food and agriculture, and energy use and the built environment –
    responsible for 70% of the life-cycle environmental impacts of
    Western societies – with the aim of stimulating, fostering or
    forcing change to SCP theory in practice. Energy consumption is
    obviously a key issue for sustainability, primarily because it
    depletes non-renewable fossil fuels, produces CO2 and other
    pollution. As climate change is becoming a key political issue, and
    as oil prices rise, society has become acutely aware of this issue.
    Energy is a special case because it is a key input to almost all
    other consumption and production processes. Housing is, with
    transport and food, a major consumer of energy, accounting for about
    one quarter of the environmental impact from the general consumption
    of products in the European Union, on a par with food and transport.
    Energy use in houses and buildings is also set to rise as
    populations – and the buildings they need –continue to increase. In
    France, for example, energy consumption in houses and offices
    accounts for 43% of the total national energy consumption, and
    one-quarter of national greenhouse gas emissions. The UK's 21
    million homes consume around 50 million tonnes of oil equivalent
    (responsible for 27% of UK CO2 emissions); this energy use has
    increased steadily by about 1.3% per year since 1990. Germany's
    buildings contribute one-fifth of the country's CO2 emissions.
    Beyond this, buildings are the environment where we spend most of
    our lives; they deeply influence many other consumption patterns,
    and are an important factor for life and comfort. The societal
    function and nature of buildings as they are currently constructed
    presents some key difficulties in moving towards sustainable
    consumption and production. Buildings have a long lifetime; and
    therefore they are a major target for any structural changes in
    consumption patterns. Conversely, long lifetimes come with
    associated strong inertia; therefore the stock of existing buildings
    is often an obstacle to policies aimed at behavioural change. This
    book examines, through a case study approach, opportunities to
    influence energy consumption in housing and buildings and thereby
    provide options for implementation at a macro, meso and micro level.
    A growing body of evidence shows that cases demonstrating action
    towards SCP in energy use in housing can inspire innovation through
    a range of actors. The cases include examples of steps towards the
    sustainable use of energy in houses and buildings, from'local
    experiments', to'innovative communities', to wider regime or
    non-local scale change in Europe and North America. The System
    Innovation for Sustainability series is the fruit of the first major
    international research network on SCP and will set the standard in
    this field for some years t

    System Innovation for Sustainability 2 is the first of three books

    environmental impacts of Western societies. These case studies aim
    to stimulate, foster or force change to SCP theory in practice.
    System Innovation for Sustainability 2 focuses on change towards
    sustainable personal mobility based on implemented cases analysed
    from a system perspective. It examines what changes can be made to
    help us reduce our need for mobility, or start to make use of more
    sustainable mobility systems. This is clearly a critical and highly
    problematic area, as increasing living standards of a growing global
    population have resulted in rapid rises in both car and air travel
    along with the associated pollution. Uniquely, this book approaches
    the problems and solutions from a systems perspective, explaining
    the meta-trends, specific issues for the mobility sector,
    socioeconomic trends, political considerations, socio-cultural
    developments and environmental issues. As well as the mobility
    system itself, other societal systems that impact the need for
    mobility, such as labour and taxation, are addressed in order to
    provide sustainable solutions to our current'lock-in'problems. Three
    major problem areas are considered (the'three Cs'): carbon emissions
    (and the growing contribution of mobility to the climate change
    crisis), congestion, and casualties. And each strategy proposed
    addresses one or more of these problem areas. Among the cases
    discussed are: Norway's carbon compensation scheme for air travel;
    Madrid's high-occupancy vehicle lanes; London's congestion charge
    scheme; market-based instruments such as eco-labelling for cars; and
    taxation. The book identifies opportunities for actors such as
    governments, manufacturers and consumers to intervene in the complex
    system to promote sustainable mobility. It concludes with a
    reflection on problems, trends and action needed. The System
    Innovation for Sustainability series is the fruit of the first major
    international research network on SCP and will set the standard in
    this field for some years to come. It will be required reading for
    all involved in the policy debate on sustainable production and
    consumption from government, business, academia and NGOs for
    designers, scientists, businesses and system innovators.

*Title:*
    Sustainability in Austerity : How Local Government Can Deliver
    During Times of Crisis
*Authors:*
    Philip Monaghan
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    As the economic crisis of 2008/09 unfolded, it became apparent that
    the huge mountains of debt being built up by central governments
    were unsustainable and that savage cuts would be needed to balance
    budgets. It also became clear that the public sector would be one of
    the first in line when the axe started swinging. Yet, at the very
    same time, green advocates from business, academia and civil society
    were making calls for greater investment at the local level in the
    big sustainability issues of the day such as fostering sustainable
    consumption or educating communities on making the transition to a
    low-carbon economy. The upshot is that leaders in local government
    are going to be asked to do a lot more work on environmental and
    social sustainability but with much less money. To make matters
    worse, increasing public scepticism about why we should deal with
    these dilemmas in the first place has been exacerbating the problem,
    notably exemplified by concerns over the robustness of the science
    of climate change. Local sustainability faces a perfect storm.
    Sustainability in Austerity has been written to provide local
    leaders with a lifebelt in these turbulent times. It empowers local
    authorities to address the challenges they now face – by offering a
    treasure chest of cost-neutral and powerful ways for leaders in
    local government to advance sustainability as nations emerge from
    the global recession. The book sets out the required rules for
    leadership and proposes a myriad of innovative strategies for
    self-help achieved through habit-forming behaviour change among
    council members, staff and local communities alike. Packed with
    international case studies, anecdotes and management tips derived
    from a wealth of learning by like-minded peers across the world –
    all of whom have faced and overcome serious sustainability
    challenges – the book will be a touchstone for professionals working
    in areas such as: democracy and decision-making; corporate assets
    and resources; economic development and planning; waste and
    environmental services; fleet and logistics; and community
    management. There is an impressive array of books that provide fresh
    and innovative thinking on sustainability, but the vast majority
    have ignored or overlooked inspirational stories of positive change
    in local government. Sustainability in Austerity is a game-changing
    book and will be essential reading for managers and councillors in
    local government across the world, in either emerging or developed
    economies; managers in central government; community organisation
    leaders; academics; and management consultants who work with this
    sector on policy and performance.

    for Sustainability 3 is the second of three books of case studies
    covering respectively the three key consumption areas of mobility,
    food and agriculture, and energy use and housing – responsible for
    70% of the life-cycle environmental impacts of Western societies –
    with the aim of stimulating, fostering or forcing change to SCP
    theory in practice. The availability of healthy food for all is a
    basic human need. Yet, primarily due to higher food prices, the
    overall number of undernourished people in the world increased from
    923 million in 2007 to 963 million in 2008 – the vast majority of
    whom live in developing countries. Experts estimate that close to
    half of the human impact on the environment is directly or
    indirectly related to food production and consumption. Food
    production, distribution, consumption and disposal are important in
    terms of land and resource use, pollution and emissions,
    biodiversity and landscape design. Also of key importance are health
    issues and issues surrounding the satisfaction of citizens'basic
    needs: more than 200 million adults in the European Union are
    overweight or even obese due to unhealthy diets and too little
    exercise. Sustainability issues are now clearly on the agenda for
    food producers and market actors, politicians and regulators, as
    well as being increasingly important in the decisions consumers make
    about food. A large number and variety of efforts to stimulate
    sustainability have been instigated and numerous studies, research
    programmes and publications have addressed such issues. Agri-food
    issues have also been prominent in the evolving definition of what
    sustainability means. This book focuses largely on providing answers
    to the question of how food production and consumption systems can
    stay within the limits of the carrying capacity of our natural
    environment. But it also considers the challenges of food security
    and nutrition in the context of sustainability and a growing world
    population. The book first analyses the state of the art in
    sustainable agriculture and food production in Europe. Eleven case
    studies follow, examining issues such as food policy, greening
    mainstream agricultural systems, organic farming, farmers'markets,
    sustainable food networks, eco-labelling, consumer behaviour, slow
    food and fair trade. Finally, a concluding chapter summarises what
    has been learned by the 60-plus experts active in the SCORE! food
    project. In brief: bottom-up and top-down processes have to be
    linked, industrialised nations must reduce their meat consumption,
    and agriculture should become a multifunctional sustainable system
    not only producing food but also delivering other services such as
    energy and material production, CO2 storage and recreation – which
    would have the added benefit of improving farmers'socioeconomic
    situations. The System Innovation for Sustainability series is the
    fruit of the first major international research network on

*Description:*
    Sustainable consumption and production (SCP) was adopted as a
    priority area during the World Summit on Sustainable Development in
    Johannesburg in 2002 and has since become one of the main vehicles
    for targeting international sustainability policy. Sustainable
    consumption focuses on formulating equitable strategies that foster
    the highest quality of life, the efficient use of natural resources,
    and the effective satisfaction of human needs while simultaneously
    promoting equitable social development, economic competitiveness,
    and technological innovation. But this is a complex topic and, as
    the challenges of sustainability grow larger, there is a need to
    re-imagine how SCP policies can be formulated, governed and
    implemented. The EU-funded project'Sustainable Consumption Research
    Exchanges'(SCORE!) consists of around 200 experts in the field of
    sustainable innovation and sustainable consumption. The SCORE!
    philosophy is that innovation in SCP policy can be achieved only if

    consumers are attracted to them. To understand how this might
    effectively happen, the expertise of systems thinkers must be added
    to the mix. System Innovation for Sustainability 1 is the first
    result of a unique positive confrontation between experts from all
    four communities. It examines what SCP is and what it could be,
    provides a state-of-the-art review on the governance of change in
    SCP policy and looks at the strengths and weaknesses of current
    approaches. The SCORE! experts are working with actors in industry,
    consumer groups and eco-labelling organisations in the key
    consumption areas of mobility, food and agriculture, and energy use
    and housing – responsible for 70% of the life-cycle environmental
    impacts of Western societies – with the aim of stimulating,
    fostering or forcing change to SCP theory in practice. The System
    Innovation for Sustainability series will continue with three
    further volumes of comprehensive case studies in each of these three
    critical consumption areas. Each chapter of this book examines
    problems and suggests solutions from a business, design, consumer
    and system innovation perspective. It primarily examines the
    differing solutions necessary in the consumer economies of the West,
    but also comments on the differing needs in rapidly emerging
    economies such as China, as well as base-of-the-pyramid economies.
    The System Innovation for Sustainability series is the fruit of the
    only major international research network on SCP and will set the
    standard in this field for some years to come. It will be required
    reading for all involved in the policy debate on sustainable
    production and consumption from government, business, academia and
    NGOs for designers, scientists, businesses and system innovators.

*Description:*
    Many studies on environmental and business sustainability have been
    conducted over the last couple of decades. These studies demonstrate
    that the concept of sustainability management can be applied to
    several industries. Consumers around the globe are increasingly
    interested in sustainable consumption and they turn their attention
    into sustainable products, thus, campaigning for banning companies
    and supply chains that do not operate under sustainable ethos.
    Markets, Business and Sustainability is a collection of selected
    reports that examine business sustainability, market sustainability
    and supply chain sustainability in a variety of contexts and using
    diverse methodologies. This reference work emphasizes the profound
    impact of sustainability management on markets and business. Readers
    are presented with critical analyses on different dimensions of
    sustainability. This book covers the applications of sustainable
    management techniques in construction, city logistics and the food
    industry. Sustainability management practitioners, consumers, as
    well as students and academics can enrich their understanding about
    the business dimension of sustainability and also find references of
    available literature on the subject. The information presented in
    this reference is also helpful to senior business leaders seeking to
    create a vision, mission and strategy for their companies in order
    to create sustainable value, and an organizational culture of
    sustainability.

    Governance of Integrated Product Policy : In Search of Sustainable
    Production and Consumption
*Authors:*
    Dirk Scheer
    Frieder Rubik
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2006
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    European policy patterns are in a state of transformation. New
    governance models are shifting power away from states and toward the
    involvement of all stakeholders and the idea of shared
    responsibility. It's a move from command and control to push and
    pull. What's in this new approach for the environment? This book
    provides a detailed analysis of the example of integrated product
    policy (IPP) which aims to improve the environmental performance of
    products and services through their life-cycle. All products cause
    environmental degradation in some way, whether from their
    manufacturing, use or disposal. The life-cycle of a product is often
    long and complicated. It covers all the areas from the extraction of
    natural resources, through their design, manufacture, assembly,
    marketing, distribution, sale and use to their eventual disposal as
    waste. At the same time it also involves many different actors such
    as designers, manufacturers, marketers, retailers and consumers. IPP
    attempts to systematically stimulate each phase of this complicated
    chain to improve its environmental performance. With the involvement
    of so many different products and actors there cannot be one simple
    policy measure for everything. Instead, IPP employs a whole variety
    of tools – both voluntary and mandatory – which are used to achieve
    identified objectives. These include economic instruments, the
    phase-out of dangerous materials, voluntary agreements,
    eco-labelling and product design guidelines. IPP is still in
    relative infancy and can be seen as an ongoing process hugely
    dependent on effective governance measures to ensure its continued
    success. This book presents a plethora of perspectives from
    policy-makers, researchers and consultancies, representatives from
    business, environmental and consumer associations on how to
    effectively conceptualise, institutionalise and implement IPP. The
    book is divided into four parts. First, the approach to the
    governance of IPP is examined in relation to other approaches to
    sustainable production and consumption. Second, the widely differing
    approaches to environmental product policy in practice at national,
    supranational and global level are analysed. Third, the book
    explores the challenge of designing a coherent policy mix to support
    the integration of sustainable consumption and production patterns
    by sector and theme. Finally, the book concentrates on the key issue
    of how to involve stakeholders in IPP in order to encourage
    continuous innovations for sustainability throughout the value
    chain. Governance of Integrated Product Policy aims to fill a clear
    gap in work to date on sustainable production and consumption by
    providing researchers and practitioners from politics, business and
    civil society new insights into modern environmental governance in
    practice.

    Green Consumption : The Global Rise of Eco-Chic
*Authors:*
    Bart Barendregt
    Rivke Jaffe
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Green lifestyles and ethical consumption have become increasingly
    popular strategies in moving towards environmentally-friendly
    societies and combating global poverty. Where previously
    environmentalists saw excess consumption as central to the problem,
    green consumerism now places consumption at the heart of the
    solution. However, ethical and sustainable consumption are also
    important forms of central to the creation and maintenance of class
    distinction. Green Consumption scrutinizes the emergent phenomenon
    of what this book terms eco-chic: a combination of lifestyle
    politics, environmentalism, spirituality, beauty and health.
    Eco-chic connects ethical, sustainable and elite consumption. It is
    increasingly part of the identity kit of certain sections of
    society, who seek to combine taste and style with care for personal
    wellness and the environment. This book deals with eco-chic as a set
    of activities, an ideological framework and a popular marketing
    strategy, offering a critical examination of its manifestations in
    both the global North and South. The diverse case studies presented
    in this book range from Basque sheep cheese production and Ghanaian
    Afro-chic hairstyles to Asian tropical spa culture and Dutch
    fair-trade jewellery initiatives. The authors assess the ways in
    which eco-chic, with its apparent paradox of consumption and
    idealism, can make a genuine contribution to solving some of the
    most pressing problems of our time.

*Description:*
    The working group on Sustainable Consumption and Production, under
    the Nordic Council of Ministers requested consultants from Gaia to
    identify, write out and publish best practice cases of sustainable
    consumption and production on the UNEP SCP Clearinghouse. This
    report presents nineteen initiatives that cover two particular
    themes: 1) Sustainable Lifestyles and Education and 2) Sustainable
    Public Procurement. The cases have also been added into the UNEP's
    10 Year Frame-work Program (10YFP) information platform, the SCP
    Clearinghouse which is a concrete result of Rio+20. The objective is
    to enhance international cooperation in order to accelerate a shift
    towards sustainable consumption and production in developed and
    developing countries. The SCP Clearinghouse is a web-based
    information sharing tool, which can be used by different actors as
    an inspiration for advancing SCP worldwide.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Green Public Procurement, GPP, can be an important driver of green
    transition – and must be dealt with accordingly. All five Nordic
    countries have established framework contracts at state level and
    have allocated the responsibility for the State Framework Contracts
    (SFC) to certain organisations: • Denmark: Moderniseringsstyrelsen
    and SKI • Finland: Hansel Ltd • Iceland: Rikiskaup • Sweden:
    Kammarkollegiet • Norway: DiFi, HINAS. The roles of these units
    differ, partly due to differences in the overall national structure.
    This is a short Summary Report with key findings and conclusions
    based on the Full Report (TN2016:506), which includes detailed
    country studies. The study was carried through in 2014 and 2015 and
    supervised by the Working Group for Sustainable Consumption and
    Production (i.e. HKP-group) of the Nordic Council of Ministers.

*Description:*
    The purpose of this study was to clear out how Green Public
    Procurement has been realized in state framework contracts in the
    Nordic countries, to propose country-specific ways to improve the
    situation, and to draw a general model of efficient ways to realize
    green state framework contracts. The study was carried through in
    2014 and 2015 by Bjørn Bauer and Rikke Fischer-Bogason (PlanMiljø,
    Denmark), Luitzen de Boer and Sigurd Vildåsen (Norwegian University
    of Science and Technology), and Timo Kivistö (Kivistö Consulting,
    Finland). The study was supervised by the Working Group of Nordic
    Council of Ministers for Sustainable Consumption and Production
    (i.e. HKP-group). In addition to this Full Report, the project has
    also resulted in a short Summary Report and a power point
    presentation (slides), including the key findings and conclusions.

    Locomotive Business : How Can Large Companies Be the Catalyst for

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This report explores how public sector support promotes the
    locomotive model, which is understood as partnerships between
    locomotive companies and SMEs in order to facilitate export of
    cleantech and system solutions. Support structures vary a lot among
    the Nordic countries. A main observation is that the various
    programmes in all Nordic countries had little information on the
    impacts of the instruments. Some suggestions for policy makers in
    the Nordic countries are offered, now with an understanding of the
    interaction between large businesses and SMEs, which wish to export
    clean technologies. The project was carried out from May 2014 to
    December 2014 by a consortium led by COWI with FORES, Swedish
    Entrepreneurship Forum and Tyrsky Consulting as partners. The Nordic
    Council of Minister's Working Group on Sustainable Consumption and
    Production initiated and financed the project.

*Title:*
    Buying Into the Environment : Experiences, Opportunities and
    Potential for Eco-procurement
*Authors:*
    Christoph Erdmenger
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2003
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Green purchasing - or eco-procurement - by local and central
    governments has long been recommended in documents such as Agenda 21
    to be a key - although sometimes supplemental-ingredient in the
    achievement of more environmentally responsible economies.
    Certainly, sustainable consumption cannot be considered a realistic
    goal without the full engagement of public authorities. Many
    initiatives have been undertaken in OECD countries, most
    successfully in Japan and Denmark where green public purchasing has
    been proven to be workable and highly effective, while, in other
    countries, city municipalities have successfully pioneered the
    development of sophisticated public environmental purchasing
    policies. However, for the vast majority of countries and their
    major cities, the potential for green public purchasing remains
    woefully untapped. A key question is what would be the environmental
    impact if the majority of cities in Europe replicated the success
    stories of those leading the way? Public procurement has, after all,
    been an important tool in achieving other public policy goals such
    as defence. Why should it not be used as a tool to defend the
    environment? The RELIEF project, funded by the EU's'City of Tomorrow
    and Cultural Heritage'programme was established to answer exactly
    this question: to define the true potential of eco-procurement and
    to develop a strategy for change in Europe. Buying into the
    Environment is the result of the research segment of the project
    which has now been completed. A further stage-to design a
    Europe-wide action plan will follow in 2004. The book, organised
    under the auspices of the International Council on Local
    Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) analyses national approaches
    already tested, and provides in-depth surveys on the pioneer cities
    such as Hamburg, Malmo and Zurich. Serious attention is given to
    city-specific hurdles which have been faced and overcome. The most
    relevant product groups for eco-procurement such as construction,
    transport, energy, information technology, furniture and food. are
    also analysed. Uniquely, the book also provides calculations on the
    environmental benefits potentially achievable through greener
    purchasing. Tools were developed and tested by the RELIEF
    researchers on the environmental assessment of products, public
    buying power and on evaluations of market conditions in order to
    provide scenarios for the application of green purchasing at a
    European level. The conclusions are that there is huge potential for
    both local and central governments to adapt their behaviour patterns
    and purchase in a more environmentally responsible way. For example,
    18% of the EU's Kyoto Protocol commitment could be achieved if major
    cities in the European Union purchased green electricity. The
    results are complemented by new ideas on how best to foster
    innovation in public contractual arrangements-to encourage the
    development of products such as super-energy-efficient computers and
    fuel cells-and how the legal system may require adaptation and
    reform. The results presented in this book will provide an
    indispensable resource for municipalities, governments, researchers
    and business practitioners looking for answers on how public
    procurement can have a fundamental and manifestly positive effect on
    the environment.

    How Educational Ideologies Are Shaping Global Society :
    Intergovernmental Organizations, NGOs, and the Decline of the
    Nation-State
*Series:*
    Sociocultural, Political, and Historical Studies in Education
*Authors:*
    Joel Spring
*Publication Information:*
    Mahwah, N.J. : Routledge. 2004
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In this book Joel Spring explores three major international
    educational ideologies that are shaping global society: neo-liberal
    educational ideology, human rights education, and environmentalism.
    Neo-liberal ideology reflects a rethinking of nationalist forms of
    education as the nation-state slowly erodes under the power of a
    growing global civil society. Traditional nationalist education
    attempts to mold loyal and patriotic citizens who are emotionally
    attached to symbols of the state, whereas the goal of neo-liberal
    educational ideology is to change nationalist education to serve the
    needs of the global economy. These changes are fueling a clash
    between the ideas of free-market and consumer-based neo-liberals and
    those of human rights and environmental educators. Human rights
    education is concerned with creating activist global citizens. It is
    rooted in the idea that inherent in human rights doctrines is a
    collective responsibility to ensure the rights of all people.
    Environmentalism is the most radical of the ideologies because it
    rejects the industrial and consumerist paradigm that has dominated
    most economic thought, including capitalism and communism. Spring
    synthesizes and analyzes the effect of these educational ideologies
    on shaping the future of the global society. In the concluding
    section, he compares the effect of these ideologies on global
    society with the possibility of a world divided between conflicting
    civilizations. How Educational Ideologies Are Shaping Global
    Society: Intergovernmental Organizations, NGOs, and the Decline of
    the Nation-State features: •a critical exploration of the transition
    of schooling from a function of the nation-state to a globalized
    economic and political system; •a discussion of the major
    organizations and trading blocs shaping the future globalization of
    educational policies; •an analysis of the major competing global
    ideologies of education--including national and corporate models
    that emphasize training workers for a competitive global free
    market; the worldwide network of human rights and peace educators
    who are teaching a global set of ethics; and the environmental
    movement's efforts to create a common set of educational standards
    for sustainable development and sustainable consumption; and •an
    exploration of the possible future of global educational policy and
    school organizations. By integrating a wide range of previously
    scattered information within a bold new framework for understanding
    educational ideologies and their impact on the global society,
    Spring raises important questions for researchers, professionals,
    and students in history and philosophy of education, educational
    policy, educational studies, comparative education, multicultural
    education, curriculum studies, critical media studies, global
    studies, human rights education, and related areas.

*Title:*
    The Pursuit of Sustainability: Creating Business Value Through
    Strategic Leadership, Holistic Perspectives, and Exceptional Performance
*Authors:*
    David L. Rainey
*Publication Information:*
    Charlotte, NC : Information Age Publishing. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The Pursuit of Sustainability: Creating Business Value through
    Strategic Leadership, Holistic Perspectives, and Exceptional
    Performance focuses on the hierarchical levels of sustainability,
    strategic leadership, holistic perspectives, strategic and financial
    performance. It also focuses on management constructs for developing
    and implementing cutting-edge solutions to the exciting
    opportunities and daunting challenges facing strategic leaders. It
    discusses the requisite strategic thinking, methods, techniques, and
    practices for examining, understanding, and managing in today's
    complex and turbulent business world. Sustainability and sustainable
    development are critical for creating positive outcomes and
    achieving success given the dynamics of the global economy and the
    ongoing shifts in customer expectations, emerging markets, and the
    intensity of competition. The aim of the book is to articulate
    concepts, constructs, and methodologies pertaining to how global
    corporations and small and medium size enterprises can develop and
    deploy enhanced solutions and more integrated systems that
    facilitate leading change in a more interconnected and dynamic
    business world. The basic perspective is that insightful strategic
    leaders and astute professionals and their companies can enhance
    performance, create extraordinary value, and sustain success through
    sophisticated leadership, cutting-edge management constructs, and
    state-of-the-art systems that reach across space and time. This
    includes establishing metrics on how companies can measure their
    progress in relation to global opportunities and challenges and the
    needs and expectations of people and society. The book is intended
    to provide strategic leaders, professionals, and practitioners with
    the insights, guidance, and methods for developing and implementing
    sustainable solutions and holistic management systems without
    prescribing a generalized model that supposedly would fit every
    situation. The strategic logic is really the opposite of the
    prevailing mindset of the last century in which generic concepts
    were developed by leading theorists (academics and business leaders)
    who believed that they could articulate “one-fits-all” business
    methods and models. In today's more complicated business world,
    businesses and their strategic leaders and senior professionals have
    to develop unique management constructs and business models for
    achieving the desired outcomes and sustaining success. The book
    describes and articulates how strategic leaders and professionals
    can take advantage of opportunities and challenges by addressing
    sustainability, sustainable development, and the pursuit of
    sustainability and how they can develop and deploy exciting
    solutions and effective systems in the quest for excellence.
    Excellence provides the mantra for positive change and sustainable
    success. The book consists of two parts. Part I examines the
    hierarchy of sustainability, external context, and sustainable
    solutions. It includes defining and examining overarching concepts
    and constructs pertaining to sustainability and sustainable
    development, highlighting the importance of the pursuit of
    sustainability, examining the social world and the natural
    environment, and discussing holistic perspectives and management
    constructs used to achieve sustainable success. Part II explores
    sustainable strategic leadership, creating business value, and
    management constructs pertaining to performance, vulnerabilities and
    sustainable success. Most importantly, Part II presents a strategic
    sustainability performance model that allows strategic leaders and
    professionals to discern where they fit in the hierarchy of
    sustainability.

    Certifiably Sustainable? : The Role of Third-Party Certification
    Systems: Report of a Workshop
*Authors:*
    National Research Council (U.S.)
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C. : National Academies Press. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Consumption of goods and services represents a growing share of
    global economic activity. In the United States, consumption accounts
    for more than two-thirds of gross domestic product. This trend of
    increasing consumption has brought with it negative consequences for
    the environment and human well-being. Global demand for energy,
    food, and all manner of goods is on the rise, putting strains on the
    natural and human capital required to produce them. Extractive
    industries and production processes are prominent causes of species
    endangerment. Modern economies are underpinned by substantial energy
    consumption, a primary contributor to the current climate crisis.
    Expanding international trade has led to many economic
    opportunities, but has also contributed to unfair labor practices
    and wealth disparities. While certain processes have improved or
    become more efficient, and certain practices have been outlawed or
    amended, the sheer scale of global consumption and its attendant
    impacts continue to be major challenges we face in the transition to
    sustainability. Third-party certification systems have emerged over
    the last 15 years as a tool with some promise. There has been
    anecdotal evidence of success, but to date the overall impact of
    certified goods and services has been small. Moreover, definitions
    of sustainable vary across sectors and markets, and rigorous
    assessments of these programs have been few and far between. In
    order to take a step in learning from this field of practice, the
    National Academies'Science and Technology for Sustainability Program
    held a workshop to illuminate the decision making process of those
    who purchase and produce certified goods and services. It was also
    intended to help clarify the scope and limitations of the scientific
    knowledge that might contribute to the economic success of certified
    products. The workshop, summarized in this volume, involved
    presentations and discussions with approximately 40 invited experts
    from academia, business, government, and nongovernmental organizations.

*Description:*
    The current logic of the market economy consists of extracting,
    producing, consuming and discarding. The efforts made to reduce the
    negative environmental impacts and promote recycling are not
    sufficient to offset the undesirable effects of this system
    described as'take, make and dispose”. However, this linear approach
    to production and consumption, which prioritizes economic goals at
    the expense of environmental and social goals, has reached its
    physical limit. The negative effects caused by this model threaten
    not only the stability of economies, but also the integrity of
    ecosystems, which are essential for human survival. More than ever,
    companies are pressured to adopt more sustainable models derived
    from the intensification of certain trends, such as: the increasing
    dependence on fossil fuels; the poor management of natural
    resources; climate change, which is caused mainly by the increasing
    emissions of greenhouse gases; and the competitiveness featured by
    an ever expanding global market. These trends are in line with the
    European 2020 Strategy, which sets out a number of objectives
    designed to ensure within this time-frame a change in current models
    regarding the impact on natural capital. The circular economy
    defends the same principles of sustainability, and both share the
    same concerns. The circular economy aims to eradicate waste not just
    from manufacturing processes, but systematically throughout the life
    cycles and uses of products, and their components contributing to
    make organizations and the economy more sustainable. This book
    presents a scientific perspective about sustainability and the
    circular economy, describing different approaches, focusing on
    different sectors and exploring various methodologies. Welcome to
    the world of the circular economy and sustainability.

    MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series
*Authors:*
    Kent E. Portney
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge, Massachusetts : The MIT Press. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    A concise and accessible examination of sustainability in a range of
    contemporary contexts, from economic development to government
    policy.The word “sustainability” has been connected to everything
    from a certain kind of economic development to corporate promises
    about improved supply sourcing. But despite the apparent ubiquity of
    the term, the concept of sustainability has come to mean a number of
    specific things. In this accessible guide to the meanings of
    sustainability, Kent Portney describes the evolution of the idea and
    examines its application in a variety of contemporary contexts—from
    economic growth and consumption to government policy and urban
    planning.Portney takes as his starting point the 1987 definition by
    the World Commission on Environment and Development of
    sustainability as economic development activity that “meets the
    needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
    generations to meet their own needs.” At its heart, Portney
    explains, sustainability focuses on the use and depletion of natural
    resources. It is not the same as environmental protection or natural
    resource conservation; it is more about finding some sort of steady
    state so that the earth can support both human population and
    economic growth. Portney looks at political opposition to the
    promotion of sustainability, which usually questions the need for

    Sustainability : A Biological Perspective
*Authors:*
    Morse, Stephen
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge : Cambridge University Press. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Encouraging students to engage in the challenges and complexity of
    sustainability, this text considers not only the theories underlying
    sustainability, but more importantly how theories are translated
    into practice and the difficulties of achieving this in the world in
    which we live. This pragmatic focus gives students a greater
    understanding of the practice of sustainability and highlights the
    challenges involved. Models and theories are illustrated throughout
    with real world examples to help students move away from the
    abstract and connect with genuine issues. The text begins by
    focusing on sustainable production and consumption and how they are
    related. The role of tools such as modelling and sustainability
    indicators are explored, and extended into the fields of stakeholder
    participation, livelihoods and evidence-based policy. The final
    chapter explores the interconnections between apparently disparate
    subjects and the importance of taking an interdisciplinary perspective.

    Sustainability by Design : A Subversive Strategy for Transforming
    Our Consumer Culture
*Authors:*
    Ehrenfeld, John
*Publication Information:*
    New Haven [Conn.] : Yale University Press. 2008
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The developed world, increasingly aware of inconvenient truths”
    about global warming and sustainability, is turning its attention to
    possible remedieseco-efficiency, sustainable development, and
    corporate social responsibility, among others. But such measures are
    mere Band-Aids, and they may actually do more harm than good, says
    John Ehrenfeld, a pioneer in the field of industrial ecology. In
    this deeply considered book, Ehrenfeld challenges conventional
    understandings of solving” environmental problems and offers a
    radically new set of strategies to attain sustainability. The book
    is founded upon this new definition: sustainability is the
    possibility that humans and other life will flourish on Earth
    forever. There are obstacles to this hopeful vision, however, and
    overcoming them will require us to transform our behavior, both
    individually and collectively. Ehrenfeld identifies problematic
    cultural attributessuch as the unending consumption that
    characterizes modern lifeand outlines practical steps toward
    developing sustainability as a mindset. By focusing on the being”
    mode of human existence rather than on the unsustainable having”
    mode we cling to now, he asserts, a sustainable world is within our
    reach.

    Integral Ecology and Sustainable Business

*Authors:*
    Ove Jakobsen
    Laszlo Zsolnai
*Publication Information:*
    Bingley, U.K. : Emerald Publishing Limited. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This collection addresses the relationship between business, the
    natural environment, ethics, and spirituality. While traditional
    economic theory generally assumed firms maximize profits, it has
    long been acknowledged that other factors may be important to
    understanding firm activities. The role of ethics and spirituality
    in society is clearly significant, yet economists have traditionally
    had little to say on these topics and how they intersect with
    economic activity. Integral Ecology integrates concerns for people
    and the planet. It sees the world as systemically linked to ecology,
    economy, equity and justice and accessible through the natural and
    social sciences, arts and humanities. It links to sustainable
    business through frugal consumption, acknowledging the intrinsic
    value of nature, and adopting holistic management practices. This
    insightful study provides the insights of economists, business
    scholars, philosophers, lawyers, theologians and practitioners who
    are working in Europe, North America, and Asia. Their contributions
    highlight the relationship between integral ecology and sustainable
    business practices, and explore the meaning of sustainability in
    relation to both human and non-human life, offering a series of new
    and invigorating approaches to sustainable business practices and
    sustainability leadership.

*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge : Cambridge University Press. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    As western-style food systems extend further around the world, food
    sustainability is becoming an increasingly important issue. Such
    systems are not sustainable in terms of their consumption of
    resources, their impact on ecosystems or their effect on health and
    social inequality. From 2009 to 2011, the duALIne project, led by
    INRA and CIRAD, assembled a team of experts to investigate food
    systems downstream of the farm, from the farm gate, to consumption
    and the disposal of waste. Representing a diverse range of
    backgrounds spanning academia and the public and private sectors,
    the project aimed to review the international literature and
    identify major gaps in our knowledge. This book brings together its
    key conclusions and insights, presenting state-of-the-art research
    in food sustainability and identifying priority areas for further
    study. It will provide a valuable resource for researchers,
    decision-makers and stakeholders in the food industry.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The Sustainable Renovation of Buildings and Neighborhoods is a
    collection of papers presented at the International Congress of
    Sustainable Construction and Eco‐efficient Solutions. This event has
    established itself as a forum for meeting academics from around the
    word, researchers and professionals of the construction sector, in
    which environmental information is shared with a multidisciplinary
    context, and which involves participants from different areas of the
    construction process. The congress brings together development
    proposals through a shared vision of environmental sustainability
    and presents alternative solutions to problems through technical
    presentations and trainings, in order to minimize the environmental
    impact caused by the construction sector. This monograph celebrates
    the event's second international edition and its fourth national
    edition. The volume contains selected articles written by the
    participants. Readers will find information about interesting, new
    developments and concepts on · Energy retrofitting in older
    buildings · Tools to determine and measure environmental impact and
    sustainability indicators · Economic / cost based revaluation of
    buildings through the viability of eco‐efficient solutions ·
    Reduction of the consumption of material and energy resources and in
    CO2 emissions · Sustainability research based on the renovation of
    urban areas. The studies in this book provide real examples from
    different countries (Argentina and Spain, for example). The
    Sustainable Renovation of Buildings and Neighborhoods is a useful
    reference for researchers and professional architects involved in
    sustainable development, environmental rehabilitation and the
    construction industry.

*Description:*
    This book is available as open access through the Bloomsbury Open
    Access programme and is available on
    www.bloomsburycollections.com.Continuation along current development
    pathways is not sustainable. Available technology and production
    practices and the consumption patterns of modern societies are
    leading to global warming and ecological destruction. Business as
    usual is not an option. There is an urgent need to find a new
    development paradigm that ensures environmental sustainability while
    managing to provide, now and in the future, a decent livelihood for
    all of humankind. In Technology and Innovation for Sustainable
    Development, experts in the area provide a variety of insights about
    the technical transformation needed for sustainable development. It
    spells out the behavioural and policy changes that would need to
    accompany the next technological transformation, taking into account
    the complexity of inducing technological change in the energy and
    agricultural sectors. The assessment suggests that this will require
    major, but doable improvements in national innovation systems and
    major, but affordable shifts in investment patterns and related
    macroeconomic adjustments.

    What Is Sustainable Technology? : Perceptions, Paradoxes and

*Authors:*
    Lente, Harro van
    Ferrer, Didac
    Mulder, Karel
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Designers of technology have a major responsibility in the current
    age. Their designs can have tremendous effects on society, in both
    the short and the long term. In fact, sustainable development itself
    has all the characteristics of a design project, albeit a vast one.
    But a failed product design here will be not just be unsuccessful in
    the market – it will have far-reaching consequences. It is our
    common responsibility to make the project successful. Technology has
    played an important role in creating the problems that we now face;
    but it will also play an important role in solving them. But this
    does not mean the technological fix will be easy. How do we allocate
    resources and attention when there are myriad issues under the
    umbrella of'sustainable development'currently in competition with
    one another? How do we arrive at precise specifications for the
    sustainable technologies that are to be developed and, furthermore,
    reach consensus on these specifications? What if our sustainable
    technological solutions aggravate other problems or create new ones?
    And, because sustainable development is all about the long-term
    consequences of our actions, how do we assess the effects of
    modifying existing landscapes, infrastructures and patterns of
    life?How could we be sure in advance that the changes that new
    technologies bring will make our society more sustainable? These
    dilemmas and paradoxes are the subject of this provocative book.
    Sometimes the claim that a technology is sustainable is made in
    order to make the technology acceptable in the political process, as
    in the case of nuclear energy production, where the claims
    of'sustainability'refer to the absence of CO2 emissions. In the case
    of biofuels, claims of sustainability have led to a'fuel or
    food'debate, showing that sustainability has counteracting
    articulations. And the well-known rebound effect is observed when
    increased resource efficiency can create a stimulus for consumption.
    What is Sustainable Technology? illustrates that the sustainability
    impact of a technology is often much more complicated and ambivalent
    than one might expect. Making improvements to existing designs is
    not the technological challenge that will lead to real solutions. We
    mustn't look to change a part of a machine, but rather the machine
    as a whole – or even the whole system in which it functions. It is
    these system innovations that have the potential to make a genuine
    contribution to sustainable development. What is Sustainable
    Technology? will help all those involved in designing more
    sustainable technologies in determining their strategies. It does so
    by presenting case studies of different technologies in contrasting
    contexts. Each case asks: 1. What articulations of sustainability
    played a role in the design process? 2. What sustainability effects
    did this technology lead to? 3. Who was affected, where, and when?
    4. Could the designer have foreseen these consequences? 5. How did
    the designer anticipate them? 6. How was societal interaction dealt
    with during the design process? Finally, the authors reflect on
    future options for the sustainable technology designer. They argue
    that an important first step is an awareness of the multitude of
    sustainable development challenges that play a role in production,
    use, recycling and end-of-life disposal. What is Sustainable
    Technology? will be essential reading for product designers,
    engineers, material scientists and others involved in the
    development of sustainable technologies, as well as a wide academic
    audience interested in the complexities of the sustainable design
    process.

*Title:*
    User Integration in Sustainable Product Development : Organisational
    Learning Through Boundary-Spanning Processes
*Authors:*
    Hoffmann, Esther
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 2012
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Changes in production and consumption patterns are a crucial element
    in advancing the sustainability agenda. Many companies are now
    contributing to such efforts through a focus on sustainable
    innovation when developing new products and services. However,
    problematically, many such products fail as consumers reject them in
    the marketplace. User integration in product development is a
    well-suited approach to increase the usability and the marketability
    of new products. This book asks the following question: under what
    conditions can companies trigger sustainability-oriented
    organizational learning processes by integrating consumers in
    product development? The author analyses this question by studying a
    new approach called INNOCOPE (Innovating through consumer-integrated
    product development). The analysis is based on a process model of
    organizational learning, distinguishing different learning phases
    and related boundary-spanning activities. The case study shows that
    boundary spanning and communication with external actors may
    directly affect almost all phases of the organizational learning
    process. Depending on the organizational learning phase, specific
    boundary-spanning activities are identified that can be
    characterized as outside-in, inside-in or inside-out directed
    processes. Moreover, the book describes supportive conditions for
    user integration with regard to the company, the product, the users
    involved and the communication process, and provides managerial
    recommendations. User Integration in Sustainable Product Development
    sheds new light on the interaction between companies and users in
    innovation processes and how they relate to sustainable product
    development. Its focus on organizational learning at and across the
    boundaries of companies is original, stimulating, improves our
    understanding of user–producer interactions and distinguishes the
    book from other publications on the market. The book provides a
    hugely comprehensive overview of user integration in innovation

    The Sustainable State : The Future of Government, Economy, and Society
*Series:*
    A BK Currents Book
*Authors:*
    Chandran Nair
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Oakland, CA : Berrett-Koehler Publishers. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The free-market, limited government development model has been an
    ecological and social disaster for the developing world. Sustainable
    and equitable development is only possible with the active
    involvement of a strong central state that can guide the economy,
    protect the environment, and prioritize meeting their people's basic
    needs. In this sure to be controversial book, Chandran Nair shows
    that the market-dominated model followed by the industrialized west
    is simply not scalable. The United States alone, with less than five
    percent of the world's population, consumes nearly a quarter of its
    resources. If countries in Asia, where 60% of the world's population
    lives, try to follow the Western lead, the results will be
    calamitous..Instead, Nair argues that development must be directed
    by a state that is willing and able to intervene in the economy.
    Corporations, which by design demand ever-expanding consumption,
    need to be directed towards meeting societal needs or otherwise
    restrained, not unleashed. Development has to be oriented towards
    the greatest good—clean drinking water for the many has to take
    precedence over swimming pools for the few. He provides three
    compelling case studies demonstrating the benefits of such strong
    state governance and the findings of weak state governance.This will
    mean rethinking the meaning of concepts like “prosperity,”
    “freedom,” and “rights,” and whether democracy is always the best
    way to ensure responsive government—as Nair writes, “A democracy
    that cannot work to improve the life of its citizens is not better
    than a non-democracy that can actually improve quality of life.”
    Many people will find these to be challenging ideas, but what Nair
    offers is a model suited to the realities of the developing world,
    not the assumptions of the dominant culture.

    Sustainability Challenges and Solutions at the Base of the Pyramid :
    Business, Technology and the Poor
*Authors:*
    Prabhu Kandachar
    Minna Halme
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, U.K. : Routledge. 2008
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Around the turn of the millennium it had become painfully evident
    that development aid, charity or'global business-as-usual'were not
    going to be the mechanisms to alleviate global poverty. Today, there
    is little dispute that poverty remains the most pressing global
    problem calling for innovative solutions. One recent strategy is the
    Base of the Pyramid (BoP) concept developed by Prahalad and Hart,
    which relies on entrepreneurial activity tapping into the previously
    ignored markets of the economically most disadvantaged. It is a
    process requiring innovations in several disciplines: technological,
    social and business.This book covers a number of areas. First, much
    of the current BoP discussion emphasises targeting products to the
    needs of the poor. But do we actually know what the real needs of
    the poor are? This book takes a bottom-up human-centred approach and
    examines examples that truly engage the poor in BoP product and
    service development. What types of needs assessment methodologies
    are indicated considering the cultural differences in BoP countries?
    Are the existing methodologies adequate? Do they need to be
    redefined and redeveloped? Second, the book considers how we can
    balance poverty alleviation and stimulate economic growth without
    stressing the ecosystem. Tragically, the poor are hardest hit by the
    adverse effects of environmental deterioration such as water
    shortages, climate change or the destruction of habitats. While the
    economic welfare of the poor is critical, the BoP approach must
    balance its inherent paradox of encouraging greater consumption
    while avoiding further pressures on environmental sustainability.
    The link between the BoP approach and sustainable development is a
    key feature of this book. Third, it looks at innovation and asks
    what kinds of'bottom-up'innovation (open source, technological,
    social and business) support BoP initiatives (and sustainable
    development)?Fourth, the book deals with the relationship between
    development assistance and BoP. Is a BoP strategy the antithesis to
    development aid or can these two co-exist or even complement each
    other?Finally, the book raises questions about the relationship
    between corporate responsibility and BoP. Is BoP a new form of
    corporate neo-colonialism or a new form of corporate responsibility?
    Although the BoP concept has unleashed an extensive and generally
    enthusiastic response from academics, businesses, NGOs and
    governments, the knowledge domain around this concept is still in
    the early stages of development. This book addresses that need with
    a focus on the needs of the end-users – the poor – as a starting
    point for BoP products and innovations. With contributions from both
    supporters and critics, it provides a treasure trove of global
    knowledge on how the concept has developed, what its successes and
    failures have been and what promise it holds as a long-term strategy
    for alleviating poverty and tackling global sustainability.

    China : Regional Growth and Sustainability From an Environmental
    Perspective
*Series:*
    China in Transition
*Authors:*
    Jiang, Yanqing
*Publication Information:*
    Hauppauge, New York : Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    China has achieved spectacular growth in the past forty years, and
    its economic structure has experienced great transformation. The
    country has also gradually opened up to foreign trade and direct
    foreign investment, transforming itself from a virtually completely
    closed economy into a major trading nation, and the largest
    developing-country destination for foreign direct investment in the
    world. However, since this reform, China has become a “superpower”
    in energy consumption. It has also become a big producer of
    pollution emissions. It has been widely argued that China's rapid
    processes of industrial development and opening up were relying too
    heavily on increasing inputs of environmental resources.
    Unsustainable environmental practices posed serious threats to
    China's natural environment. A growing concern China now faces is
    that the current pattern of economic development may not be
    sustainable, because it tends to lead to irreversible depletion of
    natural resources and deterioration of the ecological environment.
    The relationship between regional growth, sustainability in
    development, and the natural environment in China is thus an
    interesting and important issue that deserves further in-depth
    studies. Environmental practices play an important role in shaping
    China's regional growth, interregional inequality, and its future
    development strategies. Sustainability in growth and development
    from an environmental point of view exerts strong influences on the
    continuous restructuring and upgrading of the Chinese economy. The
    analyses in the present book delve into issues related to regional
    growth, interregional inequality, and the prospect of sustainable
    development in China from an environmental perspective. This book
    provides the reader with related facts, thoughts, models, and
    empirical results as well as discussions that shed light on those
    issues.

    The Gospel of Sustainability : Media, Market and LOHAS
*Series:*
    UPCC Book Collections on Project MUSE, Global Cultural Studies
    Supplement
*Authors:*
    Monica M. Emerich
*Publication Information:*
    Urbana : University of Illinois Press. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    From organic produce and clothing to socially conscious investing
    and eco-tourism, the lifestyles of health and sustainability, or
    LOHAS, movement encompasses diverse products and practices intended
    to contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle for people and the
    planet. In The Gospel of Sustainability, Monica M. Emerich explores
    the contemporary spiritual expression of this green cultural shift
    at the confluence of the media and the market. This is the first
    book to qualitatively study the LOHAS marketplace and the
    development of a discourse of sustainability of the self and the
    social and natural worlds. Emerich draws on myriad sources related
    to the notions of mindful consumption found throughout the LOHAS
    marketplace, including not just products and services but marketing
    materials, events, lectures, regulatory policies, and conversations
    with leaders and consumers. These disparate texts, she argues,
    universally project a spiritual message about personal and planetary
    health that is in turn reforming capitalism by making consumers more
    conscious.

*Title:*
    The Myth of Progress : Toward a Sustainable Future
*Authors:*
    Tom Wessels
*Publication Information:*
    Lebanon : University Press of New England. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In this compelling and cogently argued book, Tom Wessels
    demonstrates how our current path toward progress, based on
    continual economic expansion and inefficient use of resources, runs
    absolutely contrary to three foundational scientific laws that
    govern all complex natural systems. It is a myth, he contends, that
    progress depends on a growing economy. Wessels explains his theory
    with his three laws of sustainability: (1) the law of limits to
    growth, (2) the second law of thermodynamics, which exposes the
    dangers of increased energy consumption, and (3) the law of
    self-organization, which results in the marvelous diversity of such
    highly evolved systems as the human body and complex ecosystems.
    These laws, scientifically proven to sustain life in its myriad
    forms, have been cast aside since the eighteenth century, first by
    Western economists, political pragmatists, and governments attracted
    by the idea of unlimited growth, and more recently by a global
    economy dominated by large corporations, in which consolidation and
    oversimplification create large-scale inefficiencies in both
    material and energy usage. Wessels makes scientific theory readily
    accessible by offering examples of how the laws of sustainability
    function in the complex systems we can observe in the natural world
    around us. He shows how systems such as forests can be templates for
    developing sustainable economic practices that will allow true
    progress. Demonstrating that all environmental problems have their
    source in a disregard for the laws of sustainability that is based
    on the myth of progress, he concludes with an impassioned argument
    for cultural change.

*Description:*
    While environmentalists insist that lower rates of consumption of
    natural resources are essential for a sustainable future, many
    economists dismiss the notion that resource limits act to constrain
    modern, creative societies. The conflict between these views tinges
    political debate at all levels and hinders our ability to plan for
    the future.Supply-Side Sustainability offers a fresh approach to
    this dilemma by integrating ecological and social science approaches
    in an interdisciplinary treatment of sustainability. Written by two
    ecologists and an anthropologist, this book discusses organisms,
    landscapes, populations, communities, biomes, the biosphere,
    ecosystems and energy flows, as well as patterns of sustainability
    and collapse in human societies, from hunter-gatherer groups to
    empires to today's industrial world. These diverse topics are
    integrated within a new framework that translates the
    authors'advances in hierarchy and complexity theory into a form
    useful to professionals in science, government, and business.The
    result is a much-needed blueprint for a cost-effective management
    regime, one that makes problem-solving efforts themselves
    sustainable over time. The authors demonstrate that long-term,
    cost-effective resource management can be achieved by managing the
    contexts of productive systems, rather than by managing the
    commodities that natural systems produce.

*Description:*
    Flourishing: A Frank Conversation about Sustainability invites you
    into a conversation between a teacher, John R. Ehrenfeld, and his
    former student now professor, Andrew J. Hoffman, as they discuss how
    to create a sustainable world. Unlike virtually all other books
    about sustainability, this one goes beyond the typical stories that
    we tell ourselves about repairing the environmental damages of human
    progress. Through their dialogue and essays that open each section,
    the authors uncover two core facets of our culture that drive the
    unsustainable, unsatisfying, and unfair social and economic machines
    that dominate our lives. First, our collective model of the way the
    world works cannot cope with the inherent complexity of today's
    highly connected, high-speed reality. Second, our understanding of
    human behavior is rooted in this outdated model. Driven by the old
    guard, sustainability has become little more than a fashionable
    idea. As a result, both business and government are following the
    wrong path—at best applying temporary, less unsustainable solutions
    that will fail to leave future generations in better shape. To shift
    the pendulum, this book tells a new story, driven by being and
    caring, as opposed to having and needing, rooted in the beauty of
    complexity and arguing for the transformative cultural shift that we
    can make based on our collective wisdom and lived experiences. Then,
    the authors sketch out the road to a flourishing future, a change in
    our consumption and a new approach to understanding and acting.
    There is no middle ground; without a sea change at the most basic
    level, we will continue to head down a faulty path. Indeed, this
    book is a clarion call to action. Candid and insightful, it leaves
    readers with cautious hope.

    Sustainable Solutions : Developing Products and Services for the Future
*Authors:*
    Tischner, Ursula
    Charter, Martin
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, U.K. : Routledge. 2001
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Toughening environmental legislation, national and supra-national
    environmental product policies and growing customer demands are
    focusing the attention of companies on the environmental and broader
    social issues linked to the creation and delivery of their products
    and services. There is now an urgent need for appropriate management
    structures, practical tools and increased awareness among all
    stakeholders in the product development process and throughout the
    entire product life-cycle. These are huge issues – with major
    implications for corporate management, design and production
    strategies. Sustainable Solutions provides state-of-the-art analysis
    and case studies on why and how cutting-edge companies are
    developing new products and services to
    fit'triple-bottom-line'expectations. The book is split into three
    sections: first, the broad issues of business sustainability are
    examined with focus on sustainable production and consumption and
    consideration of North–South issues. Second, the book tackles the
    major methodologies and approaches toward organising and developing
    more sustainable products and services. Third, an outstanding
    collection of global case studies highlights the progress made by a
    wide range of companies toward dematerialisation, eco-innovation and
    design for durability. Finally, the book collects together a
    comprehensive list of web addresses of useful organisations.
    Practical and comprehensive, Sustainable Solutions will be essential
    reading for corporate managers, product designers, R&D staff,
    academics and all individuals interested in a definitive source on
    how new product and service development can and is contributing
    toward tacking the challenge of sustainable development.

*Title:*
    Building a Healthy Economy From the Bottom Up : Harnessing
    Real-World Experience for Transformative Change
*Series:*
    Culture of the Land
*Authors:*
    Anthony Flaccavento
*Publication Information:*
    Lexington, Kentucky : The University Press of Kentucky. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The global economy has witnessed important changes in recent years.
    In the United States, enterprising communities have transitioned
    from tobacco farming to growing organic produce, from extractive
    fishing to vertical farming, from nonrenewable energy consumption to
    the implementation of solar cooperatives -- and have transformed
    from impoverished neighborhoods into green development zones. Yet
    these promising achievements remain a small part of the total
    economy and are largely ignored by policy makers, pundits, and
    economists. In Building a Healthy Economy from the Bottom Up:
    Harnessing Real World Experience for Transformative Change, Anthony
    Flaccavento introduces readers to the innovators who are creating
    thriving, locally based economies and provides a road map for others
    who are interested in doing the same. He demonstrates that, despite
    the success of local initiatives like farmers'markets and clean
    energy cooperatives, true and lasting change of this type stalls
    without the appropriate discussion and implementation of public
    policies that define their lasting impact. He shows how active
    citizens can spur essential changes, generate community capital,
    increase civic dialogue, and foster sustainability
    efforts.Flaccavento skillfully combines economic analysis and public
    policy recommendations with practical solutions. His call to
    collective action will appeal to scholars, entrepreneurs,
    policymakers, community activists, environmentalists, and all
    citizens passionate about the health of their communities.

    Sustainable Technology Development
*Authors:*
    Weaver, Paul
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England : Routledge. 2000
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In the time it takes to read this sentence, about fifteen people
    will be added to the world's population. Read the sentence again,
    and there will be thirty. Tomorrow, each of these people will be
    demanding greater prosperity. Production and consumption are
    increasing fast but will have to grow even faster in the future to
    keep up with population growth and a world increasingly divided by
    inequality. How should we react to these trends? Certainly, many use
    growth figures to forecast disaster. But there is an alternative
    vision: one of a sustainable future, in which growth is seen not as
    a threat, but as the driving force behind innovation. This is the
    scenario worked out in the Netherlands by Sustainable Technology
    Development (STD), a five-year programme of research
    and'learning-by-doing'based on setting up new innovation networks
    and working with new methods to search for sustainable technological
    solutions. In order to make sustainability tangible, STD made a leap
    in time. What human needs will have to be satisfied fifty years from
    now? Taking a sustainable future vision as a starting point, STD
    demonstrated what steps we should take today for new technologies
    and systems to be in place in time. These results are now available
    for the first time in a comprehensive, specifically written
    English-language book, together with a description of the unique
    working method of STD and the results and key lessons from a set of
    the programme's illustrative case studies. This book serves as a
    manual for industry, governments and social leaders wanting to
    prepare themselves for a sustainable future. Sustainable Technology
    Development sets out the programme's underpinning philosophy and
    describes its approach, methods and findings. Delivering
    sustainability means finding ways to meet human needs using a
    fraction of the natural resources we use today. The world's richer
    nations would be wise to target at least ten-fold improvements by
    2050 in the productivity with which conventional natural resources
    and environmental services are used. And they need to bring new,
    sustainable resources on-stream to augment the resource base and
    replace the use of unsustainable alternatives. Sustainable
    Technology Development marks a significant contribution to our
    understanding of innovation processes and how these might be
    influenced in favour of sustainable technology development. In
    principle, technology could play a pivotal role in sustainable
    development. Whether it does or not depends on whether innovators
    can be encouraged to make this an explicit goal, adopt long-term
    time-horizons and search for renewable technologies. Given the long
    lead-times involved, there is no time to waste in beginning the
    search. The STD programme has begun to make inroads into one of the
    most urgent of all needs concerning sustainable development: that
    for innovation in the innovation process itself.

    Sustainability : What It Is and How to Measure It
*Authors:*
    Gilbert S. Hedstrom
*Publication Information:*
    Boston : De Gruyter. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainability: What It Is and How to Measure It begins with a
    succinct business-focused summary of how to think about the risks
    and opportunities associated with sustainability. The author then
    includes his proprietary framework, The Corporate Sustainability
    ScorecardTM C-suite rating system, including the over 140 key
    sustainability indicators that are used to rate an organization's
    sustainability efforts. Each KSI includes examples from
    organizations around the world, giving the reader a complete and
    unbiased understanding of all aspects of sustainability. The
    Scorecard has been developed over the past 20 years and used by more
    than 70 corporations to rate themselves on sustainability. Gilbert
    S. Hedstrom illustrates the use of the Scorecard with hundreds of
    examples. He discusses sustainability transformation, governance,
    and strategy and execution. Social responsibility and environmental
    stewardship form important parts of his discourse in this important
    contribution to the debate on sustainability that will benefit
    business executives and those interested in sustainability and
    business. Read the author's related article on the NACD blog here:

    Can Earth's and Society's Systems Meet the Needs of 10 Billion
    People?: : Summary of a Workshop
*Authors:*
    Mellody, Maureen
    National Research Council (U.S.)
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C. : National Academies Press. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The Earth's population, currently 7.2 billion, is expected to rise
    at a rapid rate over the next 40 years. Current projections state
    that the Earth will need to support 9.6 billion people by the year
    2050, a figure that climbs to nearly 11 billion by the year 2100. At
    the same time, most people envision a future Earth with a greater
    average standard of living than we currently have - and, as a
    result, greater consumption of our planetary resources. How do we
    prepare our planet for a future population of 10 billion? How can
    this population growth be achieved in a manner that is sustainable
    from an economic, social, and environmental perspective? Can Earth's
    and Society's Systems Meet the Needs of 10 Billion People? is the
    summary of a multi-disciplinary workshop convened by the National
    Academies in October 2013 to explore how to increase the world's
    population to 10 billion in a sustainable way while simultaneously
    increasing the well-being and standard of living for that
    population. This report examines key issues in the science of
    sustainability that are related to overall human population size,
    population growth, aging populations, migration toward cities,
    differential consumption, and land use change, by different
    subpopulations, as viewed through the lenses of both social and
    natural science.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Like a tsunami, consumerism has engulfed human cultures and Earth's
    ecosystems. Left unaddressed, we risk global disaster. But if we
    channel this wave, intentionally transforming our cultures to center
    on sustainability, we will not only prevent catastrophe, but may
    usher in an era of sustainability—one that allows all people to
    thrive while protecting, even restoring, Earth. In State of the
    World 2010, sixty renowned researchers and practitioners describe
    how we can harness the world's leading institutions—education, the
    media, business, governments, traditions, and social movements—to
    reorient cultures toward sustainability.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The legacies of a century of fossil-fuel based development and
    overconsumption, of treating the environment as a waste sink for
    industry and agriculture, have left devastating impacts on the
    earth's air, water and land, and these are directly implicated in
    Climate Change. In response, a number of global institutions and
    nations, including the European Union and China, have committed
    themselves to the development of a ‘circular economy'. This will
    require a transformation of today's ‘linear economy'of ‘make, use
    and dispose'as the market dictates, into a Circular Economy. The aim
    of the Circular Economy is to decouple economic growth from resource
    and energy use through iterative, systemic social, economic and
    technological reform. This book presents new theoretical and
    practical insights into this concept, based on case studies from
    both the developing and developed world, with an emphasis on
    economic and material transformation, design for reuse and waste
    reduction, industrial ‘symbiosis'(the planned circulation of
    resources and energy within an industrial setting), and social
    innovation and entrepreneurship. Four central themes emerge through
    the essays presented here: the importance of ‘restorative design'in
    transforming resource flows through both production and consumption,
    the value of understanding and enumerating wastes in more detail to
    enable their reuse, the central role of advancing technology and
    applied science to further this transformation of materials for
    reuse, and finally, a reconfiguration of design, consumption and
    retail, so that the present ‘linear'economy of ‘make, use and
    trash'can be replaced with a more ‘circular'model.

    Philosophy of Management and Sustainability : Rethinking Business
    Ethics and Social Responsibility in Sustainable Development
*Authors:*
    Jacob Dahl Rendtorff
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Bingley : Emerald Publishing Limited. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Using an interdisciplinary focus, this book combines the research
    disciplines of philosophy, business management and sustainability to
    aid and advance both scholarly and practitioner understanding of
    sustainability management and the United Nations'Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs). As businesses and society continue to
    transition towards further sustainable development and corporate
    social responsibility, the key challenge faced is in rethinking the
    philosophy of management and business ethics to achieve this change
    in deep and lasting ways. Jacob Dahl Rendtorff explores the
    philosophical foundations of business ethics, economics and
    sustainability through four key themes: From CSR and business ethics
    to sustainable development goals (SDGs) Philosophy of management and
    ethical economy of sustainability Foundations of philosophy of
    management, ethics and sustainability Responsible management of
    sustainability. In reflecting on the works of philosophers and
    scholars such as Hannah Arendt, Paul Ricœur, Thomas Piketty and
    Peter Koslowski within the context of sustainability, globalization,
    anthropocene ethics and corporate social responsibility, the book
    presents a key understanding of the vital philosophical foundations
    for creating progressive business models in a more sustainable society.

*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Bingley, United Kingdom : Emerald Publishing
    Limited. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Concerns about environmental, social, economic, health, and other
    impacts in the building industry have led to the development of a
    number of environmental and sustainability assessment approaches,
    strategies, models, appraisals, and methodologies. Green technology
    and practices have been implemented to improve sustainable
    development performance and yield economic, social, and
    environmental benefits and a series of environmental and
    sustainability rating systems (ESRSs) have been developed around the
    world and used extensively with unquestionable benefits to
    stakeholders in the building industry. Such systems beg to be
    adapted and implemented in other industry contexts still seeking
    suitable tools with which to effectively communicate their
    commitment to a sustainable future and gain the “social license” to
    operate. Sustainability Assessment: A Rating System Framework for
    Best Practices shows how this can be done. It makes the case for the
    development and implementation of ESRSs in new industry contexts
    ranging from, manufacturing and transportation to mining and energy
    putting forward a new project sustainability rating system framework
    to assess the sustainability of a wide variety of organizations and
    projects. This assessment framework includes but is not limited to
    regulatory requirements, and includes approaches for measuring
    sustainability on social, economic, environmental, and health
    grounds. This book will be of interest to researchers and
    practitioners across a wide range of disciplines and industries.
    Scientists will find technical insights here that can further
    research while practitioners will find that they can implement the
    framework in any type of organization or project in order to address
    stakeholders'needs and expectations while achieving their short,
    mid, and long term sustainability vision and goals.

    Green Urbanism Down Under : Learning From Sustainable Communities in
    Australia
*Authors:*
    Timothy Beatley
    Peter Newman
*Publication Information:*
    Washington [D.C.] : Island Press. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In this immensely practical book, Timothy Beatley sets out to answer
    a simple question: what can Americans learn from Australians about
    “greening” city life? Green Urbanism Down Under reports on the
    current state of “sustainability practice” in Australia and the many
    lessons that U.S. residents can learn from the best Australian
    programs and initiatives. Australia is similar to the United States
    in many ways, especially in its “energy footprint.” For example,
    Australia's per capita greenhouse gas emissions are second only to
    those of the United States. A similar percentage of its residents
    live in cities (85 percent in Australia vs. 80 percent in the United
    States). And it suffers from parallel problems of air and water
    pollution, a national dependence on automobiles, and high fossil
    fuel consumption. Still, after traveling throughout Australia,
    Beatley finds that there are myriad creative responses to these
    problems—and that they offer instructive examples for the United
    States. Green Urbanism Down Under is a very readable collection of
    solutions. Although many of these innovative solutions are
    little-known outside Australia, they all present practical
    possibilities for U.S. cities. Beatley describes “green transport”
    projects, “city farms,” renewable energy plans, green living
    programs, and much more. He considers a host of public policy
    initiatives and scrutinizes regional and state planning efforts for
    answers. In closing, he shares his impressions about how Australian
    results might be applied to U.S. problems. This is a unique book:
    hopeful, constructive, and filled with ideas that have been proven
    to work. It is a “must read” for anyone who cares about the future
    of American cities.

*Description:*
    Energy is an essential factor in development, since it stimulates,
    and supports economic growth, and development. Any form of energy
    can be transformed into another form, but the total energy always
    remains the same. Several different kinds of energy exist to explain
    all known natural phenomena. The word ‘green'designates more than a
    colour. It is a way of life, one that is becoming more and more
    common throughout the world. An interesting topic on ‘sustainable
    technologies for a greener world'details about what each technology
    is and how it achieves green goals. Over the years, all parts of a
    commercial refrigerator, such as the compressor, heat exchangers,
    refrigerant, and packaging, have been improved considerably due to
    the extensive research and development efforts carried out by
    academia and industry. However, the achieved and anticipated
    improvement in conventional refrigeration technology are incremental
    since this technology is already nearing its fundamentals limit of
    energy efficiency is described is ‘magnetic refrigeration'which is
    an evolving cooling technology. Recently, conventional chillers
    using absorption technology consume energy for hot water generator
    but absorption chillers carry no energy saving. With the aim of
    providing a single point solution for this dual purpose application,
    a product is launched but can provide simultaneous chilling and
    heating using its vapour absorption technology with 40% saving in
    heating energy. Using energy efficiency and managing customer energy
    use has become an integral and valuable exercise. The reason for
    this is green technology helps to sustain life on earth. This not
    only applies to humans but to plants, animals and the rest of the
    ecosystem. Energy prices and consumption will always be on an upward
    trajectory. In fact, energy costs have steadily risen over last
    decade and are expected to carry on doing so as consumption grows.

    Urban Sustainability and Justice : Just Sustainabilities and
    Environmental Planning
*Series:*
    Just Sustainabilities
*Authors:*
    Vanesa Castán Broto
    Linda Westman
*Publication Information:*
    London, UK : Zed Books. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Urban Sustainability and Justice presents an innovative yet
    practical approach to incorporate equity and social justice into
    sustainable development in urban areas, in line with the commitments
    of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda.
    This work proposes a feminist reading of just
    sustainabilities'principles to reclaim sustainability as a
    progressive discourse which informs action on the ground. This work
    will help the committed activist (whether they are on the ground,
    working in a community, in a non-governmental organization (NGO), in
    a business, at a university, in any sphere in government) to connect
    their work to international efforts to deliver environmental justice
    in cities around the world.Drawing on a comparative, international
    analysis of sustainability initiatives in over 200 cities, Castán
    Broto and Westman find limited evidence of the implementation of
    just sustainabilities principles in practice, but they argue that
    there is considerable potential to develop a justice-oriented
    sustainability agenda. Highlighting current successes while also
    assessing prospects for the future, the authors show that just
    sustainabilities is not merely an aspirational discourse, but a
    frame of reference to support radical action on the ground.

*Resource Type:*

*Description:*
    From meat consumption to automobile production to hydropower, Vital
    Signs, Volume 20 documents over two dozen trends that are shaping
    our future in concise analyses and clear tables and graphs. The
    twentieth volume of the Worldwatch Institute series demonstrates
    that while remarkable progress has been made over the past year,
    much remains to be done to get the planet on a more sustainable
    track. Worldwide, people are waking up to the realities of a
    resource-constrained planet: investments and subsidies for renewable
    energy have reached new heights, consumers are slowly shifting away
    from meat-heavy diets, and new employment structures like
    co-operatives are democratizing the global economy. Yet with over 1
    billion people lacking access to electricity, natural disasters that
    are more costly than ever before, and an adherence to the factory
    farm model of food production, it is clear that many obstacles loom
    on the horizon. Covering a wide range of environmental, economic,
    and social themes, Vital Signs, Volume 20 is the go-to source for
    straightforward data and analyses on the latest issues facing an
    increasingly crowded planet. By placing each trend within a global
    framework, Vital Signs, Volume 20 identifies the solutions we need
    to transition toward a more sustainable world. This book will be
    especially useful for policymakers, environmental nonprofits, and
    students of environmental studies, sustainability, or economics.

*Description:*
    State-of-the-art assessments of current research into the human
    dimensions of global environmental change and promising directions
    for future advancements.The colossal human ecological footprint now
    threatens the sustainability of the entire planet. Scientists,
    policymakers, and other close observers know that any understanding
    of the causes of global environmental change is a function of
    understanding its human dimension—the range of human choices and
    actions that affect the environment. This book offers a
    state-of-the-art assessment of research on the human dimensions of
    global environmental change, describing how global threats to
    sustainability have come about, providing an interpretive framework
    for understanding environmental change, reviewing recent work in the
    social and ecological sciences, and discussing which paths for
    future advances in our knowledge may prove most promising. The
    chapters, by prominent North American and European authors, offer
    perspectives on population, consumption, land cover and use,
    institutional actions, and culture. They discuss such topics as
    risk, the new Structural Human Ecology approach to analyzing
    anthropogenic drivers of global environmental change, recent
    progress in understanding land use change, international
    environmental regimes, the concept of the commons, and the
    comparative vulnerability of societies around the

    Sustainable Resource Management : Global Trends, Visions and Policies
*Authors:*
    Stefan Bringezu
    Raimund Bleischwitz
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainable Resource Management is the result of years of exhaustive
    research by Germany's Wuppertal Institute. Looking at material
    flows, industrial and societal metabolism and their implications for
    the economy, this important new book provides radical perspectives
    on how the global economy should use natural resources in
    intelligent ways that maximise well-being without destroying
    life-supporting ecosystems. It presents a vision of the future and
    the fundamental elements necessary for the sustainable management of
    the Earth's resources. It argues that the need to manage the use of
    our natural resources at a sustainable level can be shaped into a
    great opportunity for innovation and for new institutions to govern
    change.Sustainable Resource Management first provides an overview of
    the methods it has used to analyse the physical basis of our
    economies, from the product and firm level through to sectors and
    whole countries, considering material flows and life-cycle-wide
    impacts on the environment. Indicators are described that reflect
    the volume, structure and physical growth of the socio-industrial
    metabolism, resource productivity and the share of domestic and
    foreign resource use. By accounting for the global land use of
    different countries and regions, the book aims to better assess the
    global implications of domestic activities. For example, linkages
    are made between the consumption of food and non-food to land use
    change, such as the expansion of cropland at the expense of natural
    ecosystems.Sustainable Resource Management presents a number of key
    findings. Comparing the resource use of the EU with the USA, Japan
    and China, it determines why there is a difference. It provides
    evidence about the decoupling of resource use from economic growth,
    at the expense of an increased reliance on foreign supply. There are
    two closely analysed case studies, on platinum group metals (PGM)
    and biofuels, which provide insights into the key drivers of
    resource use and related problem shifting. Another key finding is
    that only a limited number of sectors, both on the production and
    consumption side, are actually associated with major resource
    requirements and atmospheric emissions – so synergies between
    resource conservation and climate protection can be found. Evidence
    is also given of a possible link between a low level of resource
    productivity and a high risk of unemployment.Sustainable Resource
    Management also looks into the future and provides visions of
    sustainable resource use, including the necessary conditions for a
    sustainable metabolism in the EU. Four example-rich visions are laid
    out approaching the future from different angles: the
    resource-efficient and recycling-based industry, the steady-stocks
    society, the solarised technosphere, and the balanced bio-economy.
    Each examines key conditions for a low-risk and high-opportunity
    future, while accounting for likely trade-offs between
    dematerialisation and rematerialisation, between renewable energy
    sources and non-renewable materials, between construction and
    deconstruction of buildings and infrastructures, and between
    domestic production and the import of biomass products.Finally,
    Sustainable Resource Management provides a blueprint for how a more
    sustainable future may be achieved. It analyses the legitimacy of
    public policies for sustainable resource management, looks at market
    deficits and barriers, and considers the global nature of the
    challenge. Crucially, it lays down the key elements of a strategy
    roadmap: First, better information, dissemination and knowledge
    generation. Second, innovative market policies to encourage new
    business models. Third, industry-specific policies – particularly
    where current resource use patterns are significant and a huge
    demand for adaptation and system innovation exist, such as in
    automotive or metal production. Last but not least, an international
    convention on sustainable resource management is proposed.This
    significant new book will be

*Description:*
    Advances in Environmental Accounting & Management aims to advance
    knowledge of the governance and management of corporate
    environmental impacts and the accounting for these, including issues
    related to measurement, valuation, and disclosure. It also aims to

    in this volume (Dr Yousuf Kamal) is set in the context of the
    Bangladeshi garment industry, while the second chapter (Delphine
    Gibassier) explores the practice of water accounting. The remainder
    of this volume presents three chapters from the 3rd French
    Conference on Social and Environmental Accounting Research, guest
    edited by Sophie Giordano-Spring, Jonathan Maurice and Charles H.
    Cho. These chapters consider sustainability in Canadian CPA teaching
    programmes (Emilio Boulianne and S. Leanne Keddie); mandatory
    environmental reporting in France (Juliette Senn); and CSR reporting
    practices in Brazil and South Korea (Hyemi Shin and Adrián Zicari).

    The Sustainable City
*Authors:*
    Steven Cohen
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Columbia University Press. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Living sustainably is not just about preserving the wilderness or
    keeping nature pristine. The transition to a green economy depends
    on cities. For the first time in human history, the majority of the
    people on the planet live in urban areas. If we are to avert climate
    catastrophe, we will need our cities to coexist with nature without
    destroying it. Many places are already investing in the
    infrastructure of the future—including renewable energy, energy
    efficiency, mass and personal transit, and advanced sewage and waste
    management—but the modern city still has a long way to go.In The
    Sustainable City, Steven Cohen provides a broad and engaging
    overview of the urban systems of the twenty-first century, surveying
    policies and projects already under way in cities around the world
    and pointing to more ways progress can be made. Cohen discusses the
    sustainable city from an organizational-management and public-policy
    perspective that emphasizes the local level, looking at case studies
    of existing legislation, programs, and public-private partnerships
    that strive to align modern urban life and sustainability. From
    waste management in Beijing to energy infrastructure in Africa to
    public space in Washington, D.C., there are concrete examples of
    what we can do right now. Cohen synthesizes the disparate strands of
    sustainable city planning in an approachable and applicable guide
    that highlights how these issues touch our lives on a daily basis,
    whether the transportation we take, where our energy comes from, or
    what becomes of our food waste. Providing recommendations and
    insights with immediacy and relevance, this book has invaluable
    lessons for anyone seeking to link public policy to promoting a
    sustainable lifestyle.

*Description:*
    This book has the ambition of presenting sustainability issues in a
    simple way to students in the field of agriculture and the
    environment. There is much diversity in the viewpoints on the
    meaning of sustainability. Sustainability must be made operational
    in each specific context and scaled, and appropriate methods must be
    designed to achieve long-term goals for the environment,
    agriculture, energy and food security. The ultimate goal of the
    environment and agriculture is protecting soil and water to ensure
    food security for the growing population. This book discusses the
    integration of views pertaining to the sustainability of
    agriculture, the environment, renewable energy and food security.

*Description:*
    Taking the slogan'think globally, act locally'to heart, the
    contributors to Fatal Consumption are theoretical as well as
    practical. They conceptualize the policy analysis they provide,
    while also proposing useful tools for those charged with making
    decisions. Though specific in focus, the analysis in Fatal
    Consumption can be generalized to most North American urban areas.
    It offers both an understanding of the present and hope for a
    sustainable future, counterbalancing a discussion of the
    opportunities for change with a frank examination of the barriers to
    such change.

    Daniel C. Esty
*Publication Information:*
    London : Anthem Press. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    ‘The Labyrinth of Sustainability'offers the first comprehensive
    effort to analyze corporate sustainability systematically in the
    Latin American context—and to extract lessons for companies across
    the developing world. Featuring an introduction by the prizewinning
    author and Yale professor Daniel Esty, the book starts off with
    examining the “sustainability imperative”—the notion that businesses
    must work toward sustainability to be successful in today's
    marketplace. The 12 chapters that follow present a collection of
    carefully developed and tightly framed case studies from companies
    across Latin America highlighting how they are addressing this
    imperative. Contributions from leading experts around the region
    bring a freshness and authenticity as well as a nuanced and grounded
    approach that make this volume a must-read for business leaders,
    government officials, non-governmental organization advocates,
    journalists and academics in Latin America and across the world.

*Description:*
    In 1999 the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
    Medicine released a landmark report, Our Common Journey: A
    Transition toward Sustainability, which attempted to â€œreinvigorate
    the essential strategic connections between scientific research,
    technological development, and societiesâ€™ efforts to achieve
    environmentally sustainable improvements in human well-being.â€1 The
    report emphasized the need for place-based and systems approaches to
    sustainability, proposed a research strategy for using scientific
    and technical knowledge to better inform the field, and highlighted
    a number of priorities for actions that could contribute to a
    sustainable future. The past 15 years have brought significant
    advances in observational and predictive capabilities for a range of
    natural and social systems, as well as development of other tools
    and approaches useful for sustainability planning. In addition,
    other frameworks for environmental decision making, such as those
    that focus on climate adaptation or resilience, have become
    increasingly prominent. A careful consideration of how these other
    approaches might intersect with sustainability is warranted,
    particularly in that they may affect similar resources or rely on
    similar underlying scientific data and models. â€¨ To further the
    discussion on these outstanding issues, the National Academies of
    Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine convened a workshop on January
    14â€'15, 2016. Participants discussed progress in sustainability
    science during the last 15 years, potential opportunities for
    advancing the research and use of scientific knowledge to support a
    transition toward sustainability, and challenges specifically
    related to establishing indicators and observations to support
    sustainability research and practice. This report summarizes the
    presentations and discussions from the workshop.

    Household Consumption in Japan? Role of Income and Asset Developments
*Authors:*
    Vihri?al?a, Erkki
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C., UNITED STATES : INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    We study Japanese household consumption at a disaggregated level
    focusing on the role of income and asset dynamics. Stagnation of
    real per capita consumption is widespread acrosslabor market groups,
    age groups and regions. Consumption-to-income ratios have been
    mildly increasing due to the rising share of pensioners with
    significant assets. Evidence therefore suggests that assets have
    become more important in financing consumption. However, the
    short-term consumption dynamics remain quite sensitive to income
    growth but not to asset market movements.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainable development is becoming the guiding principle for the
    twenty-first century. This textbook - based on the author's course
    and rigorously class-tested by his students - provides an
    introduction into patterns of past and present (un)sustainable
    development and into the emergence of the notion of sustainable
    development. It systematically surveys the key concepts, models and
    findings of the various scientific disciplines with respect to the
    major sustainability issues: energy, nature, agro-food and resource
    systems, and economic growth. System analysis and modelling is
    introduced and used as an integrating tool. Stories and worldviews
    are used to connect the quantitative and the qualitative and to
    offer the reader an understanding of relevant trends and events in
    context. Sustainability Science is an ideal textbook for advanced
    undergraduate and graduate level courses in sustainable development
    and in environmental and resource science and policy.

*Description:*
    Giving voice to the marginalized, broadly defined, is the aim of
    this volume in its examination of social life increasingly marked by
    global inequality and the extension of market rationalities to all
    arenas. Revealing the outcome to populations, stakeholders, and the
    environment when policies resting on narrowly constrained logics are
    employed, these researchers lead the way in probing accountings
    participation in significant struggles of our times. In order to
    better appreciate the consequences of economic globalization, the
    works examine contemporary rhetoric, governance, politics, and
    strategies and the manner in which accounting technologies are
    integrated. These works maintain that transformation is inevitable
    and they search for possibilities of change that can be manifested
    in socially equitable practices and improved social justice by
    enhancing accountability.

*Description:*
    It is now 20 years since the United Nations Conference on
    Environment and Development, better known as the Earth Summit was
    held in Rio de Janeiro. An important achievement of the conference
    was an agreement on the Climate Change Convention which in turn led
    to the Kyoto Protocol. Another was agreement to'not carry out any
    activities on the lands of indigenous peoples that would cause
    environmental degradation or that would be culturally
    inappropriate'. Recently we have seen an updated and revised
    conference in Rio where the same issues were again discussed. Since
    then ideas about sustainability have changed considerably and to
    some extent they have merged with ideas about corporate social
    responsibility and about governance, determined by the economic and
    political fortunes of the actors involved. It is now time therefore
    to re-examine the concept of sustainability in the aftermath of this
    conference and to consider what issues are now considered pertinent
    around the world. This book therefore takes different positions
    concerning different aspects of this vital topic.

    This volume presents the evolutionary path of Corporate Social
    Disclosure (CSD), or sustainability disclosure, which is the set of
    tools and information that companies have to produce in order to be
    accountable to their stakeholders. Particular emphasis is given to
    the Integrated Reporting (IR), the most recent proposal about CSD,
    with the aim to identify key practical implications for companies
    and present performance measurement and control frameworks. The
    issues discussed in the book are of interest for both academics and
    practitioners, involved in researching, designing and managing
    sustainability performance measurement and communication systems.

*Description:*
    Written by 18 authors, this book on Sustainability, Climate Change
    and the Green Economy brings together insights at the nexus of the
    four key concepts embedded in its title. The book is unpacked in six
    parts. Part 1 is a single chapter that covers the context of the
    topic. Part 2 looks at the green economy and green jobs, and
    addresses the challenges of government coordination and
    socio-economic development, with emphasis on skills and immigration
    regimes. Part 3 reflects on sustainable development, with a focus on
    relearning our wants and needs, and provides critical reflection on
    engineering for sustainable development. Management of natural
    resources and wetlands makes up Part 4, which teases out issues on
    timber harvesting, as well as challenges and opportunities in
    addressing environment-economic development and growth conflicts. A
    critique of climate change coverage in news media, mainstreaming
    climate change into wildlife policies, and tourism, are matters
    covered in Part 5. The last part (Part 6) is another single chapter,
    which articulates emerging issues from the whole book and presents
    some policy and take-home messages. Given the growing literature in
    the field of sustainability, climate change and the green economy,
    this piece will prove a must-read for policy makers, academics,
    industry and civil society.

*Description:*
    The economic and sociocultural significance of tourism today cannot
    be overstated. With the rapid growth of travel and tourism, more and
    more research is being undertaken in this field, with particular
    attention paid to the concept of sustainability.This book broadens
    the reach of such studies by providing comprehensive and rigorous
    examinations of many issues and concepts related to sustainable
    tourism, with particular attention paid to Slovenia. It considers
    the area broadly, and presents in-depth discussions on many relevant
    and important tourism issues, covering topics from the sustainable
    use of cultural heritage in tourism and the development of
    sustainable jobs and professionalism in the tourism sector to the
    aspects of systemic management and logistic planning for tourist
    destinations, as well as the contributions that local governments
    make towards sustainable development and use of local resources. The
    collection provides a unique and balanced view of both theoretical
    issues and practical cases and is a valuable reading for students,
    researchers and professionals in the field of tourism and
    sustainability.

*Authors:*
    Kumar, Ashok

*Publication Information:*
    Sharjah : Bentham Science Publishers Ltd. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Campus activities for sustainable development are an effective way
    of learning and implementing sustainability in surrounding
    communities and industry. A college campus is an ideal place to
    practice and test new ideas and to learn valuable lessons from the
    results and mistakes. Sustainability Practice and Education on
    University Campuses and Beyond showcases many ideas and endeavors
    pursued on college campuses in the form of case studies. These case
    studies include past, current and projected activities to green
    college campuses. Specific topics covered in this book include
    student-driven and college-driven environmental sustainability
    programs in undergraduate and graduate classes, issues in teaching
    environmental sustainability, the LEED certification of
    universities, issues of shrinking cities, and a comparison of
    sustainable military bases with college campuses. Readers will be
    able to clearly understand the concept of sustainable development
    through a textbook approach to'crazy'ideas presented in the book. In
    addition, the pedagogical challenges in sustainability education
    mentioned in the book address key issues arising due to the
    multidisciplinary nature of sustainability curricula. Sustainability
    Practice and Education on University Campuses and Beyond is a good
    resource on sustainability in environmental science courses for
    college students, faculty and sustainability-related researchers.
    Decision makers in government and industry positions looking for
    ideas for promoting sustainable development can also benefit from
    the contents of this book.

*Description:*
    The German Alumni Summer School 2018 on ‘Education, science and
    cooperation between German Alumni for sustainable development and
    biodiversity conservation in Sub-Saharan Africa'was jointly
    organized by the Faculty of Geography-Department of Cartography, GIS
    and Remote Sensing, the Faculty of Biology and Psychology-Department
    of Conservation Biology, and the Karatina University, Kenya – School
    of Natural Resources and Environmental Studies. This summer school
    was funded by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and
    targeted to the German Alumni from Sub-Saharan Africa as well as
    scientist and experts from various discipline. The European Union
    being confronted with mass migration from Sub-Saharan Africa is
    currently working on a new political and economic strategy for
    Africa. Moreover German Government initiated and proposed a new
    level of equal cooperation between Africa and western countries in
    areas such as education, trade, business development and energy. The
    main idea is to limit the effects of climate change and avoid
    climate refugees, to prevent mass migration and to help create a
    future for Africa's youth', and underscores the current status and
    efforts of German development policy towards African countries.
    Sub-Saharan Africa comprises of 49 states with the highest
    population growth, and by the end of the 21st century the population
    is likely to triple. The average economic growth rate for
    Sub-Saharan Africa countries slowed down from 5.1% in 2010 to 1.4%
    in 2016. Africa is still the world's poorest continent and
    widespread poverty is the primary cause of malnutrition and health
    problems. Catastrophes like famines and the recent hunger in Horn of
    Africa are additionally induced through climate change and land
    grabbing. Corruption, armed conflict, political and ethnic tension,
    terrorist activities, unstable state structures, national debt,
    dependence on global commodities markets, and inequitable world
    trade mechanisms are mainly responsible for this unstable and
    threatening situation. Biodiversity loss and diminishing of African
    wildlife due to habitat loss and poaching are as well the serious
    concern and calls for action.

    Women's Empowerment for Sustainability in Africa
*Authors:*
    Dibie, Robert A.
*Publication Information:*
    Newcastle upon Tyne : Cambridge Scholars Publishing. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book uses an open, explorative approach to deal with the
    different aspects of gender discrimination and gender empowerment
    policies, as well as their impact on economic development and
    capacity-building in several African countries. It uses primary and
    secondary data to present the argument that, without the full input
    of women, sustainable development will not be achieved in many
    African countries. This book is the first text written by
    knowledgeable gender issue experts that understand the culture of,
    and lived and conducted research in, Africa. It provides many
    examples of the relationships between gender and economic
    development around the African continent, highlighting different
    processes and practices. As such, the contributors here illustrate
    the impact of weak gender policies, and the ability to adequately
    develop female capacity building that could lead to wide-spread
    sustainable economic growth in Africa. They also explore a wide
    range of new dimensions and variables that are commonly ignored by
    other text books on gender equality. The book will help graduate,
    undergraduate students and other readers to understand women's
    policies in the past, present, and future by analysing and
    illustrating cultural, political and socio-historical contexts which
    have shaped women's role in the economic and sustainable development
    of Africa.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Nowhere is the study of workplace ethics more relevant today than in
    the context of empowering organizations to meet their goals in
    corporate social responsibility and sustainability (CSR/S). Aimed at
    helping organizations uphold their commitments to people and the
    planet as well as profit, these are core goals towards which both PR
    and HR departments now work. However one major stumbling block is
    the fact that while internal departments may regularly work closely
    when managing and communicating with employees, the communication
    flow tends to be top down. In order to create more socially
    responsible, sustainable, and ethical organizations, the
    communication flow must be more organic and bilateral. The question
    of how both teams could work together on a more even playing field
    has escaped scholarly inquiry for years. Corporate Social
    Responsibility, Sustainability, & Ethical Public Relations:
    Strengthening Synergies with Human Resources examines ways to make
    CSR/S an integrated ingredient and ethical hallmark for an
    organization's culture. Here authors from around the globe use a
    variety of research methods to offer practical, empirical findings,
    exploring opportunities for employees to serve as a conduit for
    organizations'CSR/S goals. This book shows how HR-PR department
    cooperation can fulfil the role of organizational conscience,
    helping for-profits and non-profits to navigate toward greater CSR/S.

    Hooked on Growth : Economic Addictions and the Environment

*Publication Information:*
    Lanham : Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. 2004
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Challenging conventional wisdom on the virtues of a consumer
    economy, this provocative book explores the nexus between growth and
    environment sustainability. The miracle of the modern affluent
    economy is an ever-swelling cornucopia of consumer goods, leading to
    expanding consumption as the essential underpinning of economic
    growth in more and more parts of the globe. Douglas Booth contends
    that expansion in this form amounts to an addiction. Are we as a
    society hooked on economic growth of a kind that carries with it
    significant threats to the natural environment? A critical dilemma
    for the modern economy is that growth is required to prevent the
    pain of unemployment. As growth continues, the environment declines,
    but if growth slows, unemployment rises. We seem trapped in a
    spiraling predicament like that of the addict. This accessible work
    explores whether getting'unhooked'from growth to meet the needs of
    the environment is possible. Giving the environment priority over
    growth may seem to some like a radical idea, yet the author argues
    that it can be accomplished using marketable emissions allowances,
    transferable development rights, and other tools popular with
    conventional economists. It can also be achieved by creating more
    interesting and environmentally friendly urban landscapes less
    beholden to the automobile. The key problem a less growth-oriented
    society will face is ensuring that everyone who wants employment can
    find it. This will require something that many people wish for
    anyway, a shorter workweek. More leisure, a higher-quality
    environment, and more attractive cities and towns are the potential
    rewards of a less consumption-oriented society.Yet powerful economic
    interests that benefit from a high-growth economy are arrayed
    against changes in the status quo. Under what circumstances can the
    power of special interests be overcome in the name of environmental
    conservation? This is the author's critical final question as he
    offers a clear path to a sustainable economic and environmental

*Description:*
    Global populations have grown rapidly in recent decades, leading to
    ever increasing demands for shelter, resources, energy and
    utilities. Coupled with the worldwide need to achieve lower impact
    buildings and conservation of resources, the need to achieve
    sustainability in urban environments has never been more acute. This
    book critically reviews the fundamental issues and applied science,
    engineering and technology that will enable all cities to achieve a
    greater level of metropolitan sustainability, and assist nations in
    meeting the needs of their growing urban populations.Part one
    introduces key issues related to metropolitan sustainability,
    including the use of both urban metabolism and benefit cost
    analysis. Part two focuses on urban land use and the environmental
    impact of the built environment. The urban heat island effect,
    redevelopment of brownfield sites and urban agriculture are
    discussed in depth, before part three goes on to explore urban air
    pollution and emissions control. Urban water resources, reuse and
    management are explored in part four, followed by a study of urban
    energy supply and management in part five. Solar, wind and
    bioenergy, the role of waste-to-energy systems in the urban
    infrastructure, and smart energy for cities are investigated.
    Finally, part six considers sustainable urban development, transport
    and planning.With its distinguished editor and international team of
    expert contributors, Metropolitan sustainability is an essential
    resource for low-impact building engineers, sustainability
    consultants and architects, town and city planners, local/municipal
    authorities, and national and non-governmental bodies, and provides
    a thorough overview for academics of all levels in this
    field.Critically reviews the fundamental issues and applied science,
    engineering and technology that will enable all cities to achieve a
    greater level of metropolitan sustainabilityWill assist nations in
    meeting the needs of their growing urban populationsChapters discuss
    urban land use, the environmental impact of the build environment,
    the urban heat island effect, urban air pollution and emissions
    control, among other topics

*Title:*
    Leadership for Sustainability : An Action Research Approach
*Authors:*
    Judi Marshall
    Gill Coleman
    Peter Reason
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Those who advocate moving towards sustainability debate how change
    can be achieved. Does it have necessarily to be top-down or can it
    also be bottom-up? Can radical organizational and social change be
    spread from'the middle'? Who can lead change when those with
    seniority and credibility are necessarily embedded in currently
    dominant mind-sets and power structures? This book focuses on what
    it means to take up leadership for sustainability, from a variety of
    organizational and social positions, and considers the consequences
    of different strategies and practices for influencing change.
    Leadership for Sustainability shows what an action research based
    practice of leadership for sustainability looks like and provides a
    sense of the personal and professional challenges this involves; it
    demonstrates how people who are influencing change draw on
    reflective practice strategically (to create a context in which they
    can be influential) and also tactically (in moment-to-moment choices
    about how to act). It also illustrates and reflects on the kinds of
    outcomes that can be expected from this work, both the specific and
    strategic achievements, and the difficulties, challenges and
    disappointments. Thus the major part of this volume consists of
    accounts by graduates of an innovative master's programme, the MSc
    in Responsibility and Business Practice, of their activities,
    projects, achievements and learning. Accompanying sections from the
    editors overview, analyse and reflect on these accounts and the
    issues they raise for notions of leadership, practice,
    sustainability and change. One substantial chapter offers ideas,
    frameworks and practices for people taking leadership. One of the
    most dispiriting aspects of the environmental challenges that beset
    us is the lack of agency that many people experience: we do not know
    what to do or how to do it. Many organizations espouse a sustainable
    approach. This may be lip service or it may be a genuine attempt to
    integrate sustainability into business strategy. Whatever form it
    takes, organizational sustainability programmes need committed,
    intelligent, reflective leadership at all levels to make them work.
    The examples in this book show how people in very different contexts
    have seized the opportunities open to them and acted with courage
    and initiative to make a difference. This book will be relevant to a
    wide range of people, including managers, consultants and others in
    commercial, non-profit, public and intergovernmental organisations
    who want to contribute to the development of a sustainable world. It
    will be of particular interest to people working in organizations
    already thinking about issues of sustainability and those who are
    seeking to take on the role of change agents in organisations or
    communities. In addition, the book will be a resource for those in
    educational fields, primarily but not exclusively higher and further
    education, who wish to work with their students to develop
    leadership practices through action research based educational
    approaches. All contributors to this book have been associated with
    the MSc in Responsibility & Business Practice at the University of
    Bath, School of Management, UK, either as tutors or participants.
    This innovative degree course used action research to engage with
    challenging issues in a wide range of business, public service and
    civil society contexts.At the heart of this book are stories from 29
    people who are seeking to make the world more environmentally
    sustainable and socially just. They report their purposes, journeys,
    impacts, learning and disappointments. Their accounts are diverse
    and from many different worlds, ranging from fast moving consumer
    goods to international forestry and conservation projects. They have
    in common that they are among the 254 graduates of an innovative
    Master's programme, the MSc in Responsibility and Business Practice
    community, who in one way or another are adopt

    Landmarks for Sustainability : Events and Initiatives That Have
    Changed Our World
*Authors:*
    Visser, Wayne
    University of Cambridge
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Landmarks for Sustainability is a high-impact, quick-reference guide
    to many of the most critical events and initiatives that have shaped
    our world, and the sustainable development agenda, over the past 20
    years and more. These include high-profile historic events – such as
    the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the Rio Earth Summit, the
    anti-globalisation protests in Seattle and Genoa and the collapse of
    Enron – as well as more subtle but no less important developments,
    such as trends in fairtrade, ethical codes and sustainable
    investment. By shining a spotlight on these and other landmark
    events and initiatives, the book draws into sharp relief the most
    significant social and environmental challenges of our time – from
    climate change and the state of the planet to poverty and
    corruption. Equally importantly, however, more than half of the book
    is dedicated to constructive global responses, such as the boom in
    clean technology, the role of the World Economic and World Social
    Forums, and the growth of ISO 14001 and SA8000 standards. Each of
    the 20 chapters follows a similar easy-access full-colour design,
    with inspiring quotations, compelling photographs, a timeline of
    associated events, a narrative description of trends, and spotlight
    features of specific initiatives or events, including charts,
    factboxes and suggestions for further reading and websites. Also
    included is the world's most comprehensive sustainability timeline,
    listing and dating 190 key sustainability-related events and
    initiatives that occurred between 1919 and 2008. All these features
    combine to make the book an essential and highly accessible resource
    for managers, teachers, students, government officials, consultants
    and activists alike. For the first time, these crucial change agents
    will have a single-source reference book, which is not only packed
    with useful facts and figures, but is also fascinating to look at
    and full of inspirational material.

    Abraham B. (Rami) Shani
*Publication Information:*
    Bingley : Emerald Group Publishing Limited. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    A large literature has been generated about sustainability, and many
    organizations, governments, communities and citizens have focused on
    it. Yet, given how quickly the limits of the current models of the
    global economy are being approached, we must accelerate the rate at
    which we learn to operate differently. This first volume of the
    Emerald series Organizing for Sustainable Effectiveness learns from
    some of the pioneers articulating these challenges and organizing to
    address them. There is an urgent need to grow the knowledge bases to
    guide the transition. Each chapter in this volume, crafted to bring
    together the knowledge of practice and theory, is based on rich
    empirical data about particular cases in which organizations are,
    individually or collectively, working to build a more sustainable
    future. Contributors bring theoretical knowledge to bear on these
    case examples and test the applicability of the formal knowledge
    base about management and organizations, while refining, modifying,
    and extending it to increase its usefulness in addressing the
    challenges of organizing for sustainable effectiveness.

*Publication Information:*

*Resource Type:*

*Description:*
    The innovation system theory has to deal with climate change as it
    generates the intellectual tools to promote development. A unified
    innovation system theory that integrates the eradication of threats
    to nature with the promotion of development is critically important
    to advance an original pedigree and trajectory of epistemology.
    Africa must learn and appreciate the costs to itself from the way
    Europe industrialised. It can neither follow nor imitate the
    European pattern of industrialisation. It has to include in its own
    development agenda both the meeting of social needs and choosing a
    path of development that would not bring ecological harm in the
    process. The African innovation system has to evolve in a nature
    protecting ñ rather than hurting ñ system; in addition, social needs
    must be met rather than exacerbating the social inequalities path of
    development.

*Description:*
    Sustainable development is all about integrating all of our present
    day needs with the needs of society, the environment and global
    citizenship, in a way that does not compromise future generations.
    Sustainable development also promotes equality, independence,
    collaboration and empowerment. By maintaining all of our resources
    and protecting nature so that future generations can also benefit,
    we encourage a sustainable society and for the environment to grow.
    Sustainable development has one main objective, which is to create
    balance between our social, environmental and economic needs, whilst
    maintaining equality and justice. The way in which we have chosen to
    live our lives in the recent past has been responsible for the
    damage that has been caused to the environment. We are polluting the
    Earth and consuming far more resources than we produce and are
    therefore damaging the development of future generations. This Book
    has been prepared in order to provide details regarding Sustainable
    Development and what is behind Sustainability.

    Sustainable Business : Integrating CSR in Business and Functions

*Authors:*
    Aagaard, Annabeth
*Publication Information:*
    Gistrup, Denmark : River Publishers. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The developments in our environment and society have made it clear
    that the way we run our businesses and govern our nations is not
    sustainable in the long run. This is also why more and more
    companies and organizations are pursuing sustainable business
    through various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities.
    While many companies facilitate a CSR strategy on the corporate
    level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated
    across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full
    business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has
    to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain
    through empowered employees and in alignment with the business
    strategy of the company. Through state-of-the-art CSR research,
    theories and models, the platform for sustainable business and CSR
    is presented in this book. Each chapter is supplemented with
    practical case examples explaining the way in which companies and
    their managers have integrated sustainable business strategy across
    their organization's functions. As is evident both in theory and
    practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by
    industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry
    have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business
    opportunities of the company. The book reveals how CSR can be
    implemented across private and public organizations as well as small
    and medium sized entities (SMEs). Theoretical and empirical topics
    discussed in the book include: Defining sustainable business and
    CSRCSR strategy integrationStakeholder managementSustainable
    innovation, management and productionChange management & change

*Description:*
    Can we grow our world economy and create opportunities for the poor
    while keeping the planet intact? Can we maintain our vibrant,
    dynamic lifestyles while ensuring the Earth stays productive and
    viable? Aimed at managers, students, scholars, and policymakers,
    Sustainability Management answers these questions in the
    affirmative, arguing it is possible for environmentally sustainable
    business practices and policies to foster economic and long-term
    growth. Written by a former analyst and consultant with the EPA,
    this book originally combines sustainable efforts in water,
    agriculture, urban, and power management to achievein practice, not
    just in theorya sustainable planet and economy. Steven Cohen begins
    with the technical, financial, managerial, and political challenges
    of such a project, and then honestly assesses sustainable practices
    in the manufacturing and service industries. He addresses renewable
    and carbon-free energy production; water sustainability, especially
    with regard to energy issues involving filtration, distribution, and
    changing rainfall patterns; food cultivation and distribution; and
    ways to maintain the interdependent systems on which we depend to
    live. Taking examples from New York City, one of the most
    sustainable and sustainability-minded metropolises in the world,
    Cohen explains how everything from construction to waste management
    can be designed to facilitate a sustainable environment, not just
    for New York but also for the world. He concludes with this
    macroscopic view, outlining the global efforts necessary to preserve
    biodiversity and ecosystems, and the impact of war, terrorism, and
    human conflict on sustainability.

*Description:*
    In recent years'research on business and sustainability, particular
    attention is being given to the motivations driving business
    managers to incorporate social and environmental strategies into
    their day-to-day business activities. Such research is critical to
    the evaluation of green management whether viewed from the
    perspective of academics, managers, policy makers or business
    students. This volume aims to assist readers to navigate the
    conceptual maze surrounding discussions of business and
    sustainability by offering critical reflection on the state of
    business action for environmental sustainability and providing
    evidence about what is actually taking place in real localities and
    businesses. The chapters in the volume are focusing on
    sustainability issues that are critical, topical, and needed at this
    stage of the discussion. The volume makes three main contributions.
    First, it offers a critical review of business engagement with
    sustainability from four perspectives: sustainability as a political
    project; sustainability as a response to environmental crisis,
    sustainability as business opportunity and sustainability as
    stakeholder management. Second, the volume examines actual
    experience in terms of the steps being taken by business and how
    these have affected business performance. Third, the volume provides
    case studies of individual organizations or institutions that reveal
    tensions and challenges to progressing sustainable business
    strategies and that offer insight into the prospects for changing
    the relationship of business to the environment.

    Australia's Role in Feeding the World : The Future of Australian

*Publication Information:*

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Earth's human population currently exceeds 7 billion, and by the
    year 2050 our planet will have at least two billion more mouths to
    feed. When faced with providing food for so many people, the idea is
    often advanced that Australia will become the'food bowl'of Asia.
    Australia currently grows enough food to feed about three times its
    population and agricultural exports are important to our economy;
    however, Australia's role in feeding the world needs careful
    consideration. This highly topical book draws together the latest
    intelligence on the sustainable production and distribution of food
    and other products from Australian farms. It examines questions that
    policy-makers, farmers, politicians, agricultural scientists and the
    general public are asking about the potential productivity of our
    arable land, the environmental and economic impacts of seeking to
    increase productivity, and the value of becoming cleaner and greener
    in our agricultural output. With chapters on the emergence of new
    markets, consumer trends in China, the biophysical constraints on
    agricultural expansion, and the various products of Australian
    agriculture and aquaculture, Australia's Role in Feeding the World
    provides valuable insight into the future of agriculture in this nation.

    Developing a Sustainable Economy in Cameroon

    Amin, Aloysius Ajab
*Publication Information:*
    Dakar, Senegal : Codesria. 2008
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Developing a Sustainable Economy in Cameroon is an ambitious effort
    as the authors try to set a blue print for Cameroon's economy. In
    the 1980s facing economic crisis, and as dictated by the structural
    adjustment programme, Cameroon sharply cut public investment
    expenditures before later cutting government consumption which were
    followed by privatisation, liquidation of public companies and
    reduction in the size of the public sector. All these measures are
    believed to have had devastating effects on the economy. Given the
    performance of the economy so far the authors suggest that much more
    effort, with a strong commitment of the main stakeholders, is
    required to guarantee sustainable economic development in Cameroon.
    Truly, very few countries in Africa possess such enormous human and
    natural resources as Cameroon does. This volume brings out the
    challenges Cameroon faces in its quest for development as well as
    for designing appropriate strategies for addressing those
    development challenges.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    With contribiutions Francesco Bandarin, Minja Yang and Mechthild
    Rössler This publication is the fourth in the Heritage Studies
    series and aims to reflect upon the many dimensions of
    sustainability and sustainable development within the Heritage
    Studies discourse. Sustainability as a concept and sustainable
    development as a goal are presented in official policies within
    UNESCO's understanding of heritage, in its paradigmatic reflections
    and in the diversity of theories and methods, including many
    different and sometimes conflicting understandings of sustainability
    within this discourse. Thus, the contributors to this publication
    discuss sustainability as it directly concerns the potential of
    different approaches to World Heritage and Intangible Heritage. The
    inclusion of the four dimensions of sustainability - environmental,
    economic, social and cultural - into the Heritage Studies discourse
    opens a new perspective on the discourse itself.

    Integrating Selected Concepts and Methods to Enhance Corporate

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The striving for sustainable development is one of the great
    challenges of the 21st century. As a result on a corporate level,
    companies are increasingly forced to broaden their scope by
    considering environmental and social aspects in their
    decision-making processes to ultimately remain competitive and
    prospering. However, the incorporation of sustainability into both
    qualitative and quantitative corporate decision-making is
    challenging and complex. Against this background the present
    doctoral dissertation reveals ways to implement and enhance
    corporate sustainability. This is done by means of integrating
    selected methods and concepts, namely the concepts of
    transdisciplinarity, reverse logistics, and green information
    systems as well as methods and tools from the discipline of
    operations research. Within seven research contributions qualitative
    and quantitative approaches are developed that improve corporate
    decision-making to achieve sustainability goals.

*Description:*
    It is impossible to ignore the connection between economic
    development and ecological sustainability— overwhelming scientific
    evidence points to anthropogenic pressures slowly destroying life on
    Earth. The need for corrective action is, therefore, critical. This
    edited compilation studies the processes that are causing
    irreversible changes in the Earth's systems. It dwells primarily on
    the change in the ecosystems that sustain human beings and examines
    the drivers, direction, and magnitude of global change. The book not
    only studies the methods that enhance the reader's understanding of
    the impact of global change but also discusses mitigation
    strategies. The emphasis is on sustainability in a framework of
    development, with special attention to equity.

    The Essentials of Economic Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Ikerd, John E.
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *1st ed. Sterling, Va : Lynne Rienner Publishers. 2012
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Though much has been written about the negative impacts of economic
    development on natural ecosystems and civil societies, few viable
    alternatives to the prevailing economic paradigms have been
    suggested. John Ikerd moves the debate forward. Ikerd outlines the
    basic principles and concepts essential to economic sustainability.
    Some of these concepts are capitalist, some are socialist, and
    others are general principles validated by philosophy or common
    sense. Putting them together, he proposes something fundamentally
    different: instead of apocalyptic pronouncements, he offers
    possibilities. Readers of any political or ideological persuasion
    will find his brief book engaging, informative, optimistic, and
    refreshing.

    Accounting for Sustainability : Practical Insights
*Authors:*
    Anthony Hopwood
    Jeffrey Unerman
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    If businesses and other organizations are to meet the many and
    complex challenges of sustainable development, then they all, both
    public and private, need to embed sustainability considerations into
    their decision-making and reporting. However, the translation of
    this aspiration into effective action is often inhibited by the lack
    of systems and procedures that take sustainability into account.
    Accounting for Sustainability: Practical Insights will help
    organizations to address these issues. The book sets out a number of
    tools and approaches that have been developed and applied by leading
    organizations to: - embed sustainability into decision-making,
    extending beyond an organization's boundaries to take into account
    suppliers, customers and other stakeholders; - measure and link
    sustainability and financial performance; - integrate sustainability
    into'mainstream'reporting, both to management and external
    stakeholders. In-depth cases studies from Aviva, BT, the Environment
    Agency, EDF Energy, HSBC, Novo Nordisk, Sainsbury's and West Sussex
    County Council show in detail how accounting for sustainability
    works in practice in a wide range of organizational contexts.

    Colonial Heritage, Memory and Sustainability in Africa : Challenges,

*Series:*

*Authors:*

    Mawere, Munyaradzi
*Publication Information:*
    Bamenda, Cameroon : Langaa RPCIG. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book serves as a drive and medium for constructive analysis,
    critical thinking, and informed change in the broad area of cultural
    heritage studies. In Africa, how to overturn the gory effects and
    reverse the wholesale obnoxious and unpardonable losses suffered
    from the excruciating experience of colonialism in a manner that
    empowers the present and future generations, remains a burning
    question. Colonial and liberation war heritage have received
    insignificant attention. The relevance, nature, and politics at play
    when it comes to the role of memory and colonial heritage in view of
    nation-building and sustainability on the continent is yet to
    receive careful practical and theoretical attention and scrutiny
    from both heritage scholars and governments. Yet, colonial heritage
    has vast potentials that if harnessed could reverse the gargantuan
    losses of colonialism and promote sustainable development in Africa.
    The book critically reflects on the opportunities, constraints, and
    challenges of colonial heritage across Africa. It draws empirical
    evidence from its focus on Zimbabwe, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana,
    Zambia, and Mozambique, to advance the thesis that cultural heritage
    in Africa, and in particular colonial heritage, faces challenges of
    epic proportions that require urgent attention.

*Publication Information:*

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Experts discuss the multiple components of sustainability, the
    constraints imposed by their linkages, and the necessity of taking a
    comprehensive view.Humanity faces immense hurdles as it struggles to
    define the path toward a sustainable future. The multiple components
    of sustainability, all of which demand attention, make understanding
    the very concept of sustainability itself a challenge. Information
    about whether global agriculture can be made sustainable, for
    example, or calculations of the global need for water are useless
    unless we understand how these issues connect to each other and to
    other components of sustainability. In this book, experts engage in
    an extended dialogue concerning these linkages, arguing for a
    comprehensive view of sustainability. They emphasize the constraints
    imposed by the relationships among the components—for example, how
    the need for clean, easily accessible water intersects with the need
    for the energy required to provide it—and distinguish those
    constraints that may pose severe limitations on humanity's future
    from those of less concern. The book also highlights areas for
    future research and debate.Linkages of Sustainability urges a
    transformation in the way we view sustainability—a transformation
    that is necessary if we are to plan responsibly for a more
    sustainable world.

    Global Development Goals and Linkages to Health and Sustainability
    is the summary of a public three-part webinar series hosted by the
    Global Environmental Health and Sustainable Development Innovation
    Collaborative between October and December, 2012. Experts within the
    fields of environmental and global health and members of government,
    academia, and civil society discussed global development goals that
    will focus on sustainable development to inform the Rio+20 post-2015
    development agenda framework, which will likely be adopted at the
    September 2015 UN General Assembly. This report focuses on possible
    health-related measures and metrics that can be utilized for
    creating new Sustainable Development Goals as the Millennium
    Development Goals sunset in 2015, using existing measurements that
    can be adapted to track progress of global sustainable development
    and human health.

    Radical Consumption
*Series:*
    McGraw-Hill Education
*Authors:*
    Jo Littler
*Publication Information:*
    Berkshire : Open University Press. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Ethical consumption, fair trade, consumer protests, brand
    backlashes, green goods, boycotts and downshifting: these are all
    now familiar consumer activities - and in some cases, are almost
    mainstream. They are part of the expanding field of'radical
    consumption'in a world where we are encouraged to shop for
    change.But just how radical are these forms of consumption? This
    book offers an interdisciplinary approach to examining contemporary
    radical consumption, analyzing its possibilities and problems,
    moralities, methods of mediation and its connections to wider
    cultural formations of production and politics. Jo Littler argues
    that we require a more expansive vocabulary and to open up new
    approaches of enquiry in order to understand the area's many
    contradictions, strengths and weaknesses. Drawing on a number of
    contemporary theories, terms and debates in media and cultural
    studies, she uses a range of specific case studies to bring theory
    to life.By analysing practices of radical consumption, the book
    explores a number of key questions: Is ethical consumption merely a
    sop for the middle classes? What are the contradictions of green
    consumption? Should we understand corporate social responsibility as
    a form of consumer-oriented greenwash? Who benefits from the new
    forms of cosmopolitan caring consumption? Can such forms of
    consumption ever move beyond their niche market status to become an
    effective political force? Can we really buy our way to a better,
    more equitable or sustainable future? Radical Consumption is
    important reading for cultural, media and sociology students.

*Description:*
    What does it mean when consumers'shop with a conscience'and choose
    products labeled as fair or sustainable? Does this translate into
    meaningful changes in global production processes? To what extent
    are voluntary standards implemented and enforced, and can they
    really govern global industries? Looking behind the Label presents
    an informative introduction to global production and ethical
    consumption, tracing the links between consumers'choices and the
    practices of multinational producers and retailers. Case studies of
    several types of products—wood and paper, food, apparel and
    footwear, and electronics—are used to reveal what lies behind
    voluntary rules and to critique predominant assumptions about
    ethical consumption as a form of political expression.

*Publication Information:*
    London : Imperial College Press. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    A major challenge of our times is to understand and manage the
    increasing complexity of socio-economic reality. This has immediate
    relevance for sustainable development. The impact of recent
    contributions from systems and complexity sciences in addressing
    this issue has not filtered down into effective practice — notably,
    there remain problems caused by the legacy of competing paradigms
    and the application of their associated methodologies. This book
    argues the urgency for the application of analytical tools that
    embody the principles of complexity management. The authors describe
    a theoretical framework based on complexity science with a focus on
    organisational and second order cybernetics, one that presents a
    powerful new insight into the concept of sustainability. The book
    also describes actual applications of the ideas in the area of
    organisational, societal and environmental management, and reflects
    upon the impact of such an approach on current practice.

    Sustainability Clauses in International Business Contracts

*Publication Information:*
    Hague : Eleven International Publishing. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainable development is a globally recognized goal. However,
    governments are failing to reach agreement on how this should be
    achieved. Private actors that are under stakeholders'pressure try to
    fill this regulatory gap by developing various types of
    transnational private regulation. However, transnational private
    regulation suffers from weak legitimacy, questionable effectiveness,
    and lack of credible enforcement. This book suggests that supply
    chain contracting may offer an alternative regulation that could
    lead away from the current regulatory impasse, or at least be one of
    the missing pieces in the puzzle. Despite the traditionally primary
    goal of business - to make a profit - companies are, under the
    imperative of corporate social responsibility (CSR), engaging in
    activities pursuing public goals in the social and environmental
    spheres. The book examines one of the tools developed to implement
    CSR into the business operations: social and environmental clauses
    in international supply chain contracts ('sustainability contractual
    clauses,'SCCs). Since there is a lack of literature and regulation
    on this topic, companies use SCCs without proper knowledge or
    guidance on why and how this should be done, and on what legal
    consequences this may have. The book fills this gap by discussing
    the use of the legal instrument of contract to pursue social and
    environmental goals; analyzing the legal framework of sustainability
    contractual clauses; examining what legal effects SCCs may have; and
    evaluating the contribution of this activity in terms of achieving
    sustainable development objectives. The aim is to explore both the
    potential and the limitations of contractual governance in achieving
    global sustainability and thus contribute to the current discussion
    on the development of new regulatory and governance designs in this
    area. (Series: Dovenschmidt Monographs - Vol. 3) [Subject:

*Title:*
    Unlocking Sustainable Cities : A Manifesto for Real Change
*Series:*
    Radical Geography
*Authors:*
    Paul Chatterton
*Publication Information:*
    London : Pluto Press. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book is a manifesto for real urban change. Today, our urban
    areas are held back by corporate greed, loss of public space and
    rising inequality. This book highlights how cities are locked into
    unsustainable and damaging practices, and how exciting new routes
    can be unlocked for real change. Across the world, city innovators
    are putting real sustainability into practice - from transforming
    abandoned public spaces and setting up community co-operatives, to
    rewilding urban nature and powering up civic energy. Paul Chatterton
    explores the power of these city experiments that harness the
    creative power of the collective, focusing on five themes:
    compassion, imagination, experimentation, co-production and
    transformation; and four city systems: mobility, energy, community
    and nature. Imagining radical alternatives, such as car-free,
    post-carbon, common and'bio-cities', this is a toolkit for unlocking
    real urban change.

*Title:*
    The Three Levels of Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Elena Cavagnaro
    George H. Curiel
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 2012
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book aims to provide the missing link in current debates around
    sustainability. The role of business, governments, NGOS and
    multilateral institutions are widely covered and many books discuss
    their possible actions, strategies and roles. But all of these
    organizations are made up of individuals. And it is individuals who
    will need to steer society and organizations toward a more just and
    equitable world.The book takes a holistic approach to sustainable
    development. The authors argue that this approach starts and ends
    with the human being. They believe that the personal dimension of
    sustainable development has been neglected and that it is clear that
    sustainable societies cannot be achieved without committed
    individuals who are convinced of the need to be part of the
    sustainability project.The authors frame their ideas around the
    Three Levels of Sustainability (TLS) framework which they argue
    addresses at least some of the weaknesses inherent in a fragmented
    approach to sustainability. Their approach encompasses societal,
    organizational and individual levels; and, by looking through the
    lens of how sustainability has evolved, provides a roadmap for
    producing the kind of leaders necessary for sustainable development
    in all of its dimensions – people, planet and profit. The focus on
    how the individual can contribute to these three dimensions is
    unique.To arrive at this multi-level and multi-dimensional
    framework, the book introduces and analyzes theories from
    sustainable development, corporate social responsibility and
    personal leadership and systemically looks for linkages between them
    that are useful for sustainability.This framework is placed firmly
    in its historical context. The authors are highly literate about the
    development and interpretations of sustainability and bring us to
    their current position via informed discussions on the history of
    economics, business-and-environment, social development, the
    corporation and the profit principle, CSR, and measurement and
    reporting.The book has been designed as both a text for students as
    well as those already in management and leadership positions in the
    private, public or non-profit sectors and will also prove invaluable
    to those wishing to familiarize themselves with sustainability.

*Description:*
    Rural communities, often the first indicators of economic downturns,
    play an important role in planning for development and
    sustainability. Increasingly, these communities are compelled to
    reimagine the paths that lead not only to economic success, but also
    to the cultural, social, environmental, and institutional pillars of
    sustainability. As the contributors to this volume demonstrate,
    there are many examples of such innovation and creativity, and many
    communities that seek out new ways to build the collaboration,
    capacity, and autonomy necessary to survive and flourish.

    Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Marcus Wagner
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2012
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book addresses the intersection of entrepreneurship, innovation
    and sustainability (EIS), presenting high-quality research
    illuminating the relationship between the three fields. The EIS
    nexus is particularly relevant from a European point of view given
    the focus of the European Commission on corporate social
    responsibility (CSR) and sustainability, as well as their prominent
    role within the European Union in general. Also, the rapid economic
    growth witnessed especially in the BRIC countries in recent years
    requires that firms reconcile sustainability aspects with
    profitability and innovation, and entrepreneurs are seen as key
    diffusers of these aims. Sustainability requires both radical and
    incremental innovation at many different levels (technology,
    product, process, system). In many cases, such innovations come from
    small and medium-sized enterprises and so the role of the
    entrepreneur is key to their success. The book is split into six
    sections. The first section examines the nexus in detail focusing on
    system-oriented connectivity between sustainability, innovation and
    entrepreneurship. The second section looks at how to nurture
    corporate entrepreneurship for sustainability; and the third
    considers'mature'industries such as automotives, chemicals and
    electronics and how sustainability aspects can be integrated into
    innovation process and strategy. The fourth section examines the
    nexus through the lens of developing countries in Africa.
    Sustainable entrepreneurship is identified as a hugely beneficial
    way to foster development. The fifth section of the book
    concentrates on SMEs; and finally the EIS nexus is approached from a
    network perspective and focuses on inter-organisational
    partnerships, which are often an important facilitator or spark for
    EIS initiatives.This book will prove to be essential for researchers
    in the EIS nexus and be of invaluable help to practitioners,
    governments and inter-governmental bodies attempting to encourage
    sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation.

    Protection Agency

*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C. : National Academies Press. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainability is based on a simple and long-recognized factual
    premise: Everything that humans require for their survival and
    well-being depends, directly or indirectly, on the natural
    environment. The environment provides the air we breathe, the water
    we drink, and the food we eat. Recognizing the importance of
    sustainability to its work, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    (EPA) has been working to create programs and applications in a
    variety of areas to better incorporate sustainability into
    decision-making at the agency. To further strengthen the scientific
    basis for sustainability as it applies to human health and
    environmental protection, the EPA asked the National Research
    Council (NRC) to provide a framework for incorporating
    sustainability into the EPA's principles and decision-making. This
    framework, Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, provides recommendations
    for a sustainability approach that both incorporates and goes beyond
    an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed by
    pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the
    1980s. Although risk-based methods have led to many successes and
    remain important tools, the report concludes that they are not
    adequate to address many of the complex problems that put current
    and future generations at risk, such as depletion of natural
    resources, climate change, and loss of biodiversity. Moreover,
    sophisticated tools are increasingly available to address
    cross-cutting, complex, and challenging issues that go beyond risk
    management. The report recommends that EPA formally adopt as its
    sustainability paradigm the widely used'three pillars'approach,
    which means considering the environmental, social, and economic
    impacts of an action or decision. Health should be expressly
    included in the'social'pillar. EPA should also articulate its vision
    for sustainability and develop a set of sustainability principles
    that would underlie all agency policies and programs.

*Authors:*
    Bándi, Gyula
*Publication Information:*
    [S.l.] : Europa Law Publishing. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The context of sustainable development went through considerable
    changes since its'official'origins in the 1980s. The original
    meaning referred to the right of development which must, however, be
    restricted by the interests of present and future generations. After
    the Rio+20 summit - parallel with the adoption of the 7th
    Environmental Action Program of the EU and many national
    sustainability strategies - the current content and interpretation
    of the principle is examined in this book, with a special focus on
    its possible implementation and the main driving forces. The book
    provides a general survey on the contemporary ideas of
    interpretation, focusing on sustainable development law. Ethical and
    legal fundamentals and the possible legal substance are presented.
    Examples of international law demonstrate that the concept is
    significant in international treaties. However, it is a question as
    to how this can meaningfully contribute to the preservation of the
    Earth's fragile ecosystem. The book has a special focus on EU policy
    and law, introducing the serious conceptual change from sustainable
    development to sustainable growth. It also looks at the appearance
    of the concept in primary law, secondary law, and judicial practice
    to embrace the likelihood of implementation. The book discusses the
    potential motivations of sustainability in governance and examines
    the compliance issues in international environmental law, focusing
    on the choices made, not by nations as unitary rational actors, but
    by the individual decision-maker and groups of decision-makers,
    looking at interactions among domestic interest groups. The model
    uses the public choice theory, supposing that the decision about the
    compliance at large depends on the benefit and cost of the projects.

    Earth at Risk : Natural Capital and the Quest for Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Claude Henry
    Laurence Tubiana
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Columbia University Press. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    We are squandering our planet's natural capital—its biodiversity,
    water and soil, and climate stability—at a blistering pace. Major
    changes must be made to steer our planet and people away from our
    current, doomed course. Though technology has been one of the
    drivers of the current trend of unsustainable development, it is
    also one of the essential tools for remedying it. Earth at Risk maps
    out the necessary transition to sustainability, detailing the
    innovations in science and technology, along with law, institutional
    design, and economics, that can and must be put to use to avert
    environmental catastrophe.Claude Henry and Laurence Tubiana begin
    with a measure of the costs of ecological damage—the erosion of
    biodiversity; air, water, and soil pollution; and the wide-reaching
    effects of climate change—and then consider the solutions that are
    either now available or close on the horizon and that may lead to a
    more sustainable global trajectory. What community-driven or
    market-based tools can be used to promote sustainable development?
    How can renewable energy and energy storage advances help us
    decrease our use of fossil fuels? How can we substitute agroecology
    for the damaging chemical methods of industrialized agriculture? Is
    international agreement on climate goals possible? Building on the
    experience of the most significant climate negotiation of the
    decade, Earth at Risk shows what a world organized along the
    principles of sustainability could look like, no matter how
    optimistic it may seem at the present moment. Though formidable
    obstacles remain to the realization of this significant transition,
    Henry and Tubiana present the case for collective initiatives and
    change that build momentum for implementation and action.

    Energy Consumption: Impacts of Human Activity, Current and Future
    Challenges, Environmental and Socio-economic Effects
*Series:*
    Energy Science, Engineering and Technology
*Authors:*
    Reiter, Sigrid
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Energy is central to sustainable development. It has huge
    environmental, social, and economic impacts, such as its influence
    on climate change, poverty reduction efforts, industrial and
    agricultural productivity and environmental and human health. The
    development of strategies towards a sustainable energy transition is
    one of the most important world challenges of the twenty-first
    century. The choices that we will make in the coming years about
    energy will determine what world future generations will inherit.
    This book gives an overview of the key issues, strategies,
    operational guidelines and policy implications of current research
    on the transition to more sustainable energy consumption. It
    investigates the important issue of the relation between human
    activities, energy systems and energy use. It addresses the
    environmental, social and economic impacts of energy consumption and
    their interrelationships. This book was written by academic and
    research experts in the field of energy, and they have developed
    strategies for an energy sustainable plan for the main
    energy-intensive sectors: energy production, transportation,
    buildings, agriculture and domestic appliances. The best
    opportunities and solutions for energy demand reduction are shown,
    including energy efficiency improvement, increases in the share of
    renewable energy sources, technological progress and behavioural
    changes in the field of energy. The aim of this work is to guide the
    reader toward more efficient policies and actions that will actually
    improve the future. The book also addresses the different issues
    faced by developing and developed countries, as well as their
    relative respective solutions. It presents various alternative
    pathways that are open to our societies. The methods of energy
    consumption assessment and modeling approaches are also discussed.
    All those who are interested in energy challenges will find
    practical knowledge and operational solutions in this book,
    providing a solid foundation for making well-informed choices in the
    future, as individuals and as societies.

    Does Aid Contribute to Sustainable Development Goals? Empirical
    Evidence From a Donor Comparison
*Authors:*
    Faust, Paul
*Publication Information:*
    Hamburg : Anchor Academic Publishing. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    No Poverty, Zero Hunger, Good Health, Well-being and Quality
    Education – these are the first priorities of the Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) that were launched jointly by all UN Member
    States on January 1, 2016. The agenda of this agreement contains 17
    main goals with a total of 169 targets and is dedicated to improving
    global living conditions and to address issues of environmental and
    economical sustainability with a planning horizon through to 2030.
    Development assistance from economically advanced countries, also
    referred to as aid, is one of the major means to provide financing
    for countries with less developed economies that face severe social
    problems, and which often cannot handle these problems alone.
    Previous studies have shown, however, that aid is ineffective and
    recommend comprehensive restructuring of the common aid practices.
    Investigations that analyse the pattern of aid flows find, moreover,
    that granting aid to certain recipient countries cannot only be
    explained by altruistic motives. They show that several strategic or
    non-strategic reasons have a high explanatory power for individual
    donor aid allocation. Against this background, the present study
    explores aid effectiveness of distinct bilateral donors. This is
    achieved by a large-scale panel data analysis applying per-capita
    economic growth, infant mortality and primary growth as indicators
    for measuring the contribution of aid to achieving the different SDGs.

    Media Construction of Environment and Sustainability in India
*Authors:*
    Prithi Nambiar
*Publication Information:*
    New Delhi : Sage Publications Pvt. Ltd. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The book analyses the role of media and communication in negotiating
    the meaning of environment and sustainability in the developmental
    context of India. As part of the global development discourse, it
    has become necessary to refocus on the meanings attributed to
    environment, sustainability, and sustainable development at the
    local and national level. The impact of these globally generated
    imperatives on a democratic, fast-developing nation like India is
    determined by the extent to which meaning negotiation through
    discourse aids their acceptance within society. Media Construction
    of Environment and Sustainability in India presents a theoretical
    framework against which the role of media and communication in
    enabling this meaning negotiation is explored and illustrated
    through textual analysis and examination of interview data. The
    uniquely theoretical and practical perspective on the discursive
    construction of these concepts will be of immense value for policy
    makers, development and media practitioners, scholars, and students
    of media and communication.

    Suburbanization Versus Peripheral Sustainability of Rural-urban

*Series:*
    Urban Development and Infrastructure
*Authors:*
    Castillo, Guadalupe Hoyos
    Czerny, Miroslawa
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The suburbanization process is an inherent, integral feature of
    urbanization and the growth of cities around the world. Since an
    increasing amount of people are seeking to live in cities, the
    latter must grow spatially, encroaching more and more markedly upon
    surrounding areas. The research on the degree to which development
    in rural areas is sustainable, as well as on the directions that
    development is taking is making the multi-aspect nature of the
    process clear, as was noted in the course of discussions on the
    obtained results taking place at different stages in the
    international fora. Many questions arising were concerned with
    specific conditioning and requirements inherent in bringing
    sustainable development into effect in areas as diversified as the
    rural and agricultural areas present around the world. The monograph
    presented here has suburbanization processes as its lead topic. In
    fact, a great number of studies have already been devoted to this,
    as well as to the closely related issue of urban sprawl. Indeed, in
    every country in which urban agglomerations are taking shape and
    metropolitanisation is occurring, there are also manifestations of
    suburbanization, and inevitably also research into that phenomenon.

*Description:*
    Today, increasingly more, the word sustainability is present in all
    kinds of discussions: at home, at work, at school, in all society.
    Conscious of the environment where we live, everybody looks to find
    the best solutions to solve problems that result from Human Being
    evolution. Management for sustainable development is a process by
    which organizations try to use all of their resources, as well as
    improve organizational and technological development, in order to
    answer not only to the present but also to future human and social
    needs. Only in this way is it possible to improve the quality of
    life. Sustainable development, therefore, is understood to be people
    centered. We have a special concern with cultural, social and
    economic dimensions, where individuals can develop together as a
    society, whilst at the same time, individual and organizational
    activities can be implemented without destroying the present
    diversity and complexity of the ecological system where we live.This
    book is about management for sustainable development in a context
    where organizations are continually facing challenges to re-use,
    recycle, reduce waste, add value, lower costs and time of
    production, and create sustainable behavior. Today's organizations
    can no longer develop their practices based on the existent
    paradigms. On the contrary, it is necessary to completely break from
    these paradigms, creating a total change of mentality in the way we
    manage organizational activities. Taking into account this reality,
    managing for sustainable development appears as a management
    philosophy focused in productivity improvement considering different
    kinds of goals, such as biological, economic and social systems
    goals. This book contributes to the exchange of experiences and
    perspectives about the state of research related to the management
    for sustainable development, as well as the future direction of this
    research field. It looks to provide support to academics and
    researchers, as well as those operating in the management field and
    who need to deal with policies and strategies related to sustainable
    development issues.

    Industrial Transformation : Environmental Policy Innovation in the
    United States and Europe
*Authors:*
    Theo de Bruijn
    Vicki Norberg-Bohm
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge, MA : The MIT Press. 2005
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The United States and European countries are experimenting with a
    new generation of policy approaches for combating environmental
    degradation. Industrial Transformation evaluates the effectiveness
    of twelve innovative voluntary, collaborative, and information-based
    programs, focusing particularly on the effectiveness of these
    programs in bringing about industrial transformation—changes in
    production and consumption structures that will help move their
    societies toward environmental sustainability. The twelve programs
    analyzed have the potential to create incentives for industry
    leadership, stimulate beyond-compliance behavior, address
    environmental degradation not currently regulated, and encourage
    innovative solutions by involving a wide range of stakeholders. The
    programs—six in the United States and six in Europe—include Energy
    Star product labeling in the United States, R&D collaboration in US
    Department of Energy programs, the US Toxic Release Inventories, the
    EU's Eco-Audit Regulation in the UK, the Dutch Target Group Policy,
    and the German End-of-Life Vehicles Program. The comparative
    analysis of the twelve programs proves that these new approaches are
    not a panacea for industrial transformation. Taken together, the
    cases provide a range of experience from which to draw lessons for
    future policy design.

*Title:*
    Harnessing Cultural Capital for Sustainability : A Pan Africanist
    Perspective

    Mawere, Munyaradzi
*Publication Information:*
    Mankon, Cameroon : Langaa RPCIG. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book argues that the basic component of any society's social
    security and sustainability is cultural capital and its ability to
    fully recognise diversity in knowledge production and advancement.
    However, with regard to African societies, since the dawn of racial
    slavery and colonialism, cultural capital - indigenous knowledge in
    particular - has iniquitously and acrimoniously suffered
    marginalisation and pejorative ragtags. Increasingly since the
    1990s, cultural capital informed by African knowledge systems has
    taken central stage in discussions of sustainability and
    development. This is not unrelated with the recognition by America
    and Europe in particular of the central role that cultural capital
    could and should assume in the logic of development and
    sustainability at a global level. Unfortunately, action has often
    failed to match words with regard to the situation in Africa. The
    current book seeks to make a difference by exploring the role that
    African cultural capital could and should assume to guarantee
    development and sustainability on the continent and globally. It
    argues that lofty pan-African ideals of collective self-reliance,
    self-sustaining development and economic growth would come to naught
    unless determined and decisive steps are taken towards full
    recognition of indigenous cultural capital on the continent.

    Small Town Sustainability : Economic, Social, and Environmental

*Authors:*
    Paul Knox
    Heike Mayer
*Publication Information:*
    Basel : Birkhäuser. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In an age where the globalization process is threatening the
    uniqueness and vitality of small towns, and where most urban
    planning discourse is directed at topics such as metropol-regions or
    mega-regions and world cities, the authors here emphasize the need
    to critically reflect on the potential of small towns.They
    illustrate how small towns can meet the challenge of a fast-paced,
    globalized world, and based on case studies, movements, programs,
    and strategies, present the local cultures that effectively and
    sustainably promote traditions and identities. Small towns often
    play a critical role in regional economies. When small towns focus
    on their specific characteristics and exploit their opportunities,
    they can become stable niches within regional, national, and global
    economies, and thus contribute significantly to shaping their
    future. The second edition is expanded to cover the intensive
    development of small towns in China and Korea. In addition, the
    authors examine the impact of the economic crisis on small towns and
    the recent development of the Slow City movement.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Be it in our home or workplace, we are becoming increasingly
    accustomed to enjoying the maximum comfort levels. To make the
    indoor environment as per our suitability is a challenging task.
    Buildings are one of the most important contributors of pollutants
    and waste that affects the urban environment and contributes to
    adverse climatic conditions. Hence, exposure to indoor air pollution
    from the combustion of biofuels is a significant public health
    hazards, affecting the poor in both rural and urban communities in
    developing countries. Furthermore, the world's view of waste has
    changed dramatically in recent years and it is now seen as a source
    to feed the ever-growing demand for energy. Nowadays, emphasis is
    being laid upon utilisation of the surrounding energy from ground
    source and other renewable energy sources to stimulate alternative
    energy sources for heating and cooling of buildings. Exploitation of
    renewable energy sources and particularly ground heat in buildings
    can contribute towards reducing dependency on fossil fuels.
    Buildings where people work require more light and moreover, in the
    buildings where people live, the energy is used to maintain the
    lighting, temperature and proper ventilation. Hence, natural
    ventilation is rapidly becoming a significant part in the design
    strategy for non-domestic buildings. Ventilation has the potential
    to reduce the environmental impact of building operations, due to
    lower energy demand for cooling. A traditional, naturally ventilated
    building can readily provide a high ventilation rate. On the other
    hand, the mechanical ventilation systems are very expensive. Heating
    and energy consumption are interesting topics not just for the
    industry. Homeowners are also on the look-out for suitable
    technologies to keep overheads as low as possible and to save energy.

    Fuzzy Measurement of Sustainability

*Publication Information:*
    New York : Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    People from many disciplines talk about sustainable development (SD)
    without having a concrete definition or idea of what it is.
    Politicians and decision-makers, biologists and environmentalists,
    engineers and scientists, philosophers and sociologists often mean
    different things when they mention SD. To take an extreme example, a
    neoclassical economist might define SD as continual economic growth
    without regard to the environmental situation, whereas at the other
    end of the spectrum, a deep ecologist might define it as the
    preservation and restoration of the ecosystem, ignoring the effect
    on the economy completely. It has become clear throughout the last
    few decades leading up to the time this book was written that our
    society is facing environmental problems of global magnitude such as
    species extinction, population explosion, global warming, water
    shortages, exhaustion of fisheries, and deforestation, among others,
    which have economic and social repercussions. Many people doubt that
    the world we shall bequeath to our descendants will be all healthy,
    supportive, and beautiful as the one we inherited from our parents.
    The fundamental questions then of the SD discussion are: Can we
    continue our present course without destroying part or most of our
    environment and society? And if we have to change course (which is
    currently the consensus opinion) how we do it? This book addresses
    one of the most fundamental questions of SD: How do we define and
    measure in the mathematical sense sustainability? In effect it
    summarizes our research in this field for the last 15 years. The
    mathematical model which we use to evaluate sustainability serves
    both as a definition and as a measuring scheme. This is done with
    the help of fuzzy logic, which is well suited to perform reasoning
    in fields where concrete mathematical models do not exist and
    concepts such as sustainability are multifaceted and often
    subjective. Fuzzy reasoning, in some respects, emulates human
    thinking and relies on expert opinion and knowledge as well as
    subjective evaluations. This multistage model is developed
    step-by-step, in the end providing sustainability assessments of
    various aspects of a society on a scale from zero to one, such as
    the environmental or societal situation of a country. All nations of
    the world for which reliable data exist are then ranked according to
    their sustainability as measured by the model. A sensitivity
    analysis reveals the most important components of sustainability for
    each country. The book is intended for undergraduate students,
    graduate students, and practitioners working in the field of
    sustainability. It is based on a course Yannis Phillis has taught at
    the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Technical
    University of Crete (TUC) at the senior/graduate level.The
    mathematical knowledge needed to follow the book is minimal and is
    all contained in the text. Computational guidance is provided for
    those who would like to write their own model.

*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C. : National Academies Press. 2012
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    A broad and growing literature describes the deep and
    multidisciplinary nature of the sustainability challenges faced by
    the United States and the world. Despite the profound technical
    challenges involved, sustainability is not, at its root, a technical
    problem, nor will merely technical solutions be sufficient. Instead,
    deep economic, political, and cultural adjustments will ultimately
    be required, along with a major, long-term commitment in each sphere
    to deploy the requisite technical solutions at scale. Nevertheless,
    technological advances and enablers have a clear role in supporting
    such change, and information technology (IT) is a natural bridge
    between technical and social solutions because it can offer improved
    communication and transparency for fostering the necessary economic,
    political, and cultural adjustments. Moreover, IT is at the heart of
    nearly every large-scale socioeconomic system-including systems for
    finance, manufacturing, and the generation and distribution of
    energy-and so sustainability-focused changes in those systems are
    inextricably linked with advances in IT. The focus of Computing
    Research for Sustainability is'greening through IT,'the application
    of computing to promote sustainability broadly. The aim of this
    report is twofold: to shine a spotlight on areas where IT innovation
    and computer science (CS) research can help, and to urge the
    computing research community to bring its approaches and
    methodologies to bear on these pressing global challenges. Computing
    Research for Sustainability focuses on addressing medium- and
    long-term challenges in a way that would have significant,
    measurable impact. The findings and recommended principles of the
    Committee on Computing Research for Environmental and Societal
    Sustainability concern four areas: (1) the relevance of IT and CS to
    sustainability; (2) the value of the CS approach to problem solving,
    particularly as it pertains to sustainability challenges; (3) key CS
    research areas; and (4) strategy and pragmatic approaches for CS
    research on sustainability.

*Title:*
    Sustainability Considerations for Procurement Tools and Capabilities
    : Summary of a Workshop
*Authors:*
    Millett, Lynette I.

*Description:*
    Federal laws, regulations, and executive orders have imposed
    requirements for federal agencies to move toward the sustainable
    acquisition of goods and services, including the incorporation of
    sustainable purchasing into federal agency decision making. Since
    the federal government is such a significant player in the market,
    its move to incorporate sustainable procurement practices could have
    a profound impact on the types of products being developed for the
    market as a whole. The General Services Administration (GSA) has
    played a key role in furthering sustainable procurement practices
    throughout the federal government. GSA is responsible for
    formulating and maintaining government-wide policies covering a
    variety of administrative actions, including those related to
    procurement and management. GSA has several ongoing activities
    related to sustainable procurement to assess the feasibility of
    working with the federal supplier community - vendors and
    contractors that serve federal agencies to measure and reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain while encouraging
    sustainable operations among suppliers. GSA has also been actively
    developing programs to assist federal agencies in making sustainable
    procurement decisions. As federal agencies cannot directly fund the
    development of sustainable procurement tools, they are particularly
    interested in understanding how to foster innovation and provide
    incentives for collaboration between developers and users of tools
    for sustainable purchasing throughout the supply chain. The training
    of procurement professionals is also a priority for these agencies.
    To assist efforts to build sustainability considerations into the
    procurement process, the National Research Council appointed a
    committee to organize a two-day workshop that explored ways to
    better incorporate sustainability considerations into procurement
    tools and capabilities across the public and private sectors. The
    workshop was designed to help participants assess the current
    landscape of green purchasing tools, identify emerging needs for
    enhanced or new tools and opportunities to develop them, identify
    potential barriers to progress, and explore potential solutions. The
    workshop provided an opportunity for participants to discuss
    challenges related to sustainable purchasing and to developing new
    procurement tools. Sustainability Considerations for Procurement
    Tools and Capabilities reviews the presenters'recommendations and
    tools currently used in sustainable procurement, such as databases
    for ecolabels and standards, codes, or regulations and other
    nontechnological tools such as policies, frameworks, rating systems,
    and product indexes.

    EDUCONOMY: Unleashing Wellbeing and Human Centered Sustainable
    Development
*Series:*
    Innovation in Human Centered Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Maria-Teresa Lepeley
*Publication Information:*
    Charlotte, NC : Information Age Publishing. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Investing in People is the world priority of the 21st century. The
    wellbeing of people is at the center of the agendas of the World
    Bank, International Monetary Fund, UN, OECD, ILO and all major
    development organizations. But the concern for people is not new.
    The celebrated books of Economics Nobel Awardees Theodore Schultz's
    Investing in People. The Economics of Population Quality and Gary
    Becker's Human Capital were published decades ago and challenged the
    same human dilemma. Yet, with few exceptions, most countries are
    still struggling for effective formulas to put people at the center
    of development. The core issue is that investing in people means
    improving the quality of education for all. But the main problem is
    that countries continue to take education as an expense, not as an
    investment in people. National budgets consider education as a
    sunken cost, rather than as an investment expected to produce high
    returns to secure quality improvement as necessary condition for
    sustainability. Shortcomings are abundant but one thing is certain:
    unless the quality of education for all is placed front and center
    in development agendas, chances for progress in the VUCA (volatile,
    uncertain, complex, ambiguous) environment are curtailed, human
    centered sustainability and wellbeing will be restrained and
    inequality will persist. The main problem it is not income
    inequality, it is education inequality. In the Knowledge Economy the
    human (as) resources formula is no longer working. Segmentation of
    the economy and education is probing increasingly counterproductive.
    The EDUCONOMY is a human centered structure for progress to optimize
    returns and minimize costs of investing in people. Gallup and
    Brandon Busteed coined the concept Educonomy to enhance the
    importance of quality in education backed up by extensive surveys
    and data bases. Lepeley's EDUCONOMY. Unleashing Wellbeing and Human
    Centered Sustainable Development takes the discussion into new
    dimensions and addresses the complexity of the challenges. People
    are the DNA of Sustainable Development. Says Lepeley challenging old
    constructs and presenting innovative formulas pioneering human
    centered economics and economics of wellbeing that frame the
    Balanced Sustainable Development ESTE (economic, social, technology,
    environment) Model. ESTE is the product of the Educonomy built on
    three fundamental pillars: the Talent Economy, the Agility Economy
    and the Quality Economy convergent with demands of the Knowledge
    Economy. In the ESTE Model education is no longer a national
    expense, it is an investment that secures high rates of returns and
    social and economic inclusiveness anchored in quality standards for all.

*Description:*
    When citizens take collaborative action to meet the needs of their
    community, they are participating in the social economy.
    Co-operatives, community-based social services, local non-profit
    organizations, and charitable foundations are all examples of social
    economies that emphasize mutual benefit rather than the accumulation
    of profit. While such groups often participate in market-based
    activities to achieve their goals, they also pose an alternative to
    the capitalist market economy. Contributors to Scaling Up
    investigated innovative social economies in British Columbia and
    Alberta and discovered that achieving a social good through
    collective, grassroots enterprise resulted in a sustainable way of
    satisfying human needs that was also, by extension, environmentally
    responsible. As these case studies illustrate, organizations that
    are capable of harnessing the power of a social economy generally
    demonstrate a commitment to three outcomes: greater social justice,
    financial self-sufficiency, and environmental sustainability. Within
    the matrix of these three allied principles lie new strategic
    directions for the politics of sustainability. Whether they were
    examining attainable and affordable housing initiatives,
    co-operative approaches to the provision of social services, local
    credit unions, farmers'markets, or community-owned power companies,
    the contributors found social economies providing solutions based on
    reciprocity and an understanding of how parts function within the
    whole—an understanding that is essential to sustainability. In these
    locally defined and controlled, democratically operated
    organizations we see possibilities for a more human economy that is
    capable of transforming the very social and technical systems that
    make our current way of life unsustainable.Contributors: Mary

*Publication Information:*

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainability cannot be achieved without good governance. The
    Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 stated
    that governance and sustainable development are intimately tied
    together and the future role and architecture of institutions, from
    local to international levels, will be crucial determinants to
    whether future policies and programmes for sustainable development
    will succeed. But these are changing times. With growing tensions
    over both globalization and regionalization, traditional systems of
    regulation are being subjected to growing pressure for reform. While
    states will continue to play a significant, if changed, role in the
    future, the importance of players from business and civil society is
    increasing. Sustainable development requires this change. Such an
    intra- and intergenerational concept cannot be achieved with a
    top-down approach, but rather needs the participation of all. In
    fact, the governance of sustainable development requires the
    exploration of new forms of both social co-operation and
    confrontation. By doing so, the different levels (global and local),
    players (state, company and civil society), control structures
    (hierarchy, market and public-private) and fields of action need to
    be taken into consideration.Governance and Sustainability examines
    the possibilities of integrating the environmental, social and
    economic dimensions of sustainable development within the framework
    of governance processes and how that might steer societies towards
    sustainability. It takes a close look at the key actors, their
    agendas and methods, forms of organization, problems and limits, as
    well as real-life examples for governance in different areas of
    society at the regional, national and international level. It is
    especially interested in exploring the nature of changes in the
    context of governance; the role of actors in such processes; and
    analysing how different forms of societal learning can improve
    governance processes. It concludes that this is a continuous
    process, characterized by conflicts and learning processes necessary
    to heighten both awareness of the complexity of the social and
    environmental problems faced and the prospects of implementing
    successful solutions. Based on a major conference hosted to assess
    the issue of governance post-Johannesburg, the book includes
    innovative insights from some of the leading thinkers in both
    sustainable development and governance from academia, business,
    multilateral organizations and NGOs. It provides a unique
    perspective on two of the key societal problems facing the world today.

    The Future of Packaging : From Linear to Circular
*Authors:*
    Tom Szaky
*Publication Information:*
    [Place of publication not identified] : Berrett-Koehler Publishers. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Outstanding Book of the Year gold medalist and “Most Likely to Save
    the Planet” from the Independent Book Publisher Awards.Tom Szaky
    sets out to do the impossible – eliminate all waste. This book
    paints a future of a “circular economy” that relies on responsible
    reuse and recycling to propel the world towards eradicating
    overconsumption and waste. Only 35 percent of the 240 million metric
    tons of waste generated in the United States alone gets recycled,
    according to the Environmental Protection Agency. This extraordinary
    collection shows how manufacturers can move from a one-way
    take-make-waste economy that is burying the world in waste to a
    circular, make-use-recycle economy. Steered by Tom Szaky, recycling
    pioneer, eco-capitalist, and founder and CEO of TerraCycle, each
    chapter is coauthored by an expert in his or her field. From the
    distinct perspectives of government leaders, consumer packaged goods
    companies, waste management firms, and more, the book explores
    current issues of production and consumption, practical steps for
    improving packaging and reducing waste today, and big ideas and
    concepts that can be carried forward.Intended to help every business
    from a small start-up to a large established consumer product
    company, this book serves as a source of knowledge and inspiration.
    The message from these pioneers is not to scale back but to innovate
    upward. They offer nothing less than a guide to designing ourselves
    out of waste and into abundance.

    Sustainability of Scholarly Information
*Authors:*
    G. G. Chowdhury
*Publication Information:*
    London : Facet Publishing. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This is the first book to discuss the sustainable development of
    digital scholarly information in three key aspects: economic, social
    and environmental sustainability. Taking as its starting point the
    premise that digital information systems and services form the
    backbone of a knowledge society and digital economy, this book
    explores the challenges of ensuring sustainability of information in
    an evolving digital world. Author Gobinda Chowdhury attempts to find
    answers to five key questions in the context of scholarly
    information systems and services; 1) How sustainable are today's
    information systems and services?; 2) How can we ensure the
    sustainability of information throughout its lifetime?; 3) Can
    today's information systems and services face the new economic
    challenges while providing easy and equitable access to information
    for everyone?; 4) Can the level and quality of information services
    be sustained over a long period of time?; 5) Can all these
    activities be performed in an environment-friendly manner? Chowdhury
    takes the approach of a research monograph based on literature
    review and meta-analysis of the issues and challenges associated
    with the various forms of sustainability of digital information
    systems and services. He proposes new models for study and research
    based on the critical analysis of developments in related areas.
    Illustrated with case studies and informed by the latest research,
    the chapters cover, economic sustainability of information,
    environmental sustainability of information, social sustainability
    of information, sustainability of digital libraries and information
    services, emerging issues and policies, sustainability of
    information models, research issues and challenges. This
    cutting-edge text is a must-read for those involved in setting
    policy and direction for information institutions, digital library
    managers and developers, researchers and students on LIS and digital
    information courses.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This volume examines the word that's on everybody's lips in
    business, in government and in society - sustainability. There are
    of course many aspects of sustainability which might be considered
    to reflect Brundtland's three pillars of economic, environmental and
    social sustainability. Others of course have different definitions
    which include such things as governance or supply chain management.
    Nevertheless business has recognised the significance of the concept
    and is responding by developing strategies to cope, although some
    would say that this is little more than window dressing. The debate
    continues however as to just what is meant by the term
    sustainability as far as business is concerned and how can this be
    achieved. This book is designed to address this debate and set it
    within the context of the global business and societal environment.

*Description:*
    Lessons from the Great Recession: At the Crossroads of
    Sustainability and Recovery examines global cases of environmental
    sustainability and economics in the context of nations from
    multi-disciplinary perspectives. The book discusses the high costs
    of decisions taken in response to the recent economic crises, which
    as a result have created a lack of investment in environmental and
    developmental considerations. This volume analyses the problems
    faced globally as economies try to build a sustainable future in the
    aftermath of the'Great Recession'. The book observes concepts of
    sustainability in the post-recession and post-bailout world around
    aspects such as Fiscal / economic / social sustainability; Financial
    sustainability (sector risks etc.); Environmental sustainability.
    Chapters scrutinise the relationships between nations and supra
    state agencies such as the UN, EU, IMF etc. in the context of
    economic crises.

    P. Lynn Kennedy
    Troy G. Schmitz
*Publication Information:*
    Bingley, U.K. : Emerald Group Publishing Limited. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    International trade agreements are central to food security. The
    links between trade and the four dimensions in food security
    (availability, access, utilization, and stability) are examined.
    Freer trade in agricultural products provides additional food
    security. This is bolstered by factors such as increasing the use of
    GMOs, reducing food waste, and increasing investment in research and
    development. Also important is the ability of poor people to obtain
    food in the presence of transportation bottlenecks. Since low-income
    households spend most of their money on food, policy makers need to
    be aware of the harm caused by high and volatile food prices. Thus,
    food security and poverty are very much linked. We provide an
    understanding of the meaning and measurement of food security and
    the impacts of government policies in poverty alleviation. In terms
    of investment in research and development, even with increased
    productivity, problems attached to food security will remain unless
    there are significant changes in global income distribution. Global
    food shortages are due more to the lack of purchasing power rather
    than lack of food supplies, with the food gap continuing to widen.

    The Hidden Potential of Sustainable Neighborhoods : Lessons From
    Low-Carbon Communities
*Authors:*
    Harrison Fraker
*Publication Information:*
    Washington : Island Press. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    How do you achieve effective low-carbon design beyond the building
    level? How do you create a community that is both livable and
    sustainable? More importantly, how do you know if you have
    succeeded? Harrison Fraker goes beyond abstract principles to
    provide a clear, in-depth evaluation of four first generation
    low-carbon neighborhoods in Europe, and shows how those lessons can
    be applied to the U.S. Using concrete performance data to gauge
    successes and failures, he presents a holistic model based on best
    practices. The four case studies are: Bo01 and Hammarby in Sweden,
    and Kronsberg and Vauban in Germany. Each was built deliberately to
    conserve resources: all are mixed-used, contain at least 1,000
    units, and have aggressive goals for energy and water efficiency,
    recycling, and waste treatment. For each case study, Fraker explores
    the community's development process and goals and objectives as they
    relate to urban form, transportation, green space, energy, water and
    waste systems, and a social agenda. For each model, he looks at
    overall performance and lessons learned. Later chapters compare the
    different strategies employed by the case-study communities and
    develop a comprehensive model of sustainability, looking
    specifically at how these lessons can be employed in the United
    States, with a focus on retrofitting existing communities. This
    whole-systems approach promises not only a smaller carbon footprint,
    but an enriched form of urban living. The Hidden Potential of
    Sustainable Neighborhoods will be especially useful for urban
    designers, architects, landscape architects, land use planners,
    local policymakers and NGOs, citizen activists, students of urban
    design, planning, architecture, and landscape architecture.

    Effective Health Communication for Sustainable Development
*Series:*
    Public Health in the 21st Century
*Authors:*
    Malikhao, Patchanee
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The health communication strategies presented in this book are based
    on the understanding that there are many factors underpinning
    health. Starting from a framework of addressing health at an
    individual, group, and structural level, we need to realize the
    impact of globalization and social determinants on health. Health
    literacy and media literacy are necessary for health communicators
    and stakeholders to communicate effectively about/on health.
    Knowledge and skills in media technology, especially new media, new
    developments in the Internet and mobile devices are important. In
    addition, intercultural communication is essential to understand and
    collaborate with others. Health communication needs collaboration
    from all sectors in society. The health communication promoted in
    this book is based on a participatory model based within the
    multiplicity paradigm. Strategies suggested in this book are
    practical examples to encourage the reader to design his/her own
    strategies to serve a particular community. Before one can devise a
    strategy for health promotion and disease prevention, one needs to
    understand that a top-down communication approach cannot change nor
    sustain people's health behaviors. On the contrary, one needs to
    create an enabling environment or a context that supports an
    individual's decision to change their behavior. How to achieve
    sustainability in health or health for all is ultimately what this
    book is about. In nine chapters, the reader is introduced to the
    history and discourses of health communication and sustainable
    development; the first part provides the reader with an in-depth
    overview of the many health communication theories, set in the
    context of globalization and localization and assessed from both
    anthropological and sociological perspectives. In the second part of
    the book, chapters systematically explain communication for/about
    health for sustainable development in general, as well as regarding
    old and new traditional and digital media in particular. The
    concluding chapters present the principles and applications of
    health communication strategies for sustainability. Sustainability
    in health can only be achieved once health equality is a reality.

*Title:*
    Sign Language, Sustainable Development, and Equal Opportunities :
    Envisioning the Future for Deaf Students
*Authors:*
    Goedele A. M. De Clerck
    Peter V. Paul
*Publication Information:*
    Washington : Gallaudet University Press. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Increased interaction between sign language communities and the
    mainstream societies in which they function is creating the
    potential for greater equality of opportunity for people who are
    deaf and hard of hearing. In this volume, renowned scholars and
    policy makers from around the world present innovative and
    groundbreaking perspectives on the relationships among sign
    language, sustainable development, and equal opportunities. The
    contributors to this volume offer creative and open-minded
    explorations of the construct of sustainability that are informed by
    their work with deaf individuals, deaf communities, families of deaf
    children, and other stakeholders. Sign Language, Sustainable
    Development, and Equal Opportunities describes sustainability in
    relation to: · identity, resilience, and well-being · partic­ipatory
    citizenship · historical perspectives on sign language use in
    educational contexts · sign language learning and teaching · human
    rights and inclusive education · literate thought and literacy · the
    sign language factor and the development of sign language
    communities in sub-Saharan Africa · sign language legislation These
    changing communities'understanding of what is required to become
    sustainable—in areas such as full participation and citizenship in
    society, economic well-being, access to quality education, and
    cultural and linguistic identity—is also taking new forms. This work
    contributes to the paradigm shifts regarding deaf emancipation and
    deaf education taking place around the world.

*Title:*
    Treasures of the Earth : Need, Greed, and a Sustainable Future
*Authors:*
    Ali, Saleem H.
*Publication Information:*
    New Haven : Yale University Press. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Would the world be a better place if human societies were somehow
    able to curb their desires for material goods? Saleem Ali's
    pioneering book links human wants and needs by providing a natural
    history of consumption and materialism with scientific detail and
    humanistic nuance. It argues that simply disavowing consumption of
    materials is not likely to help in planning for a resource-scarce
    future, given global inequality, development imperatives, and our
    goals for a democratic global society. Rather than suppress the
    creativity and desire to discover that is often embedded in the
    exploration and production of material goods—which he calls “the
    treasure impulse”—Ali proposes a new environmental paradigm, one
    that accepts our need to consume “treasure” for cultural and
    developmental reasons, but warns of our concomitant need to
    conserve. In evaluating the impact of treasure consumption on
    resource-rich countries, he argues that there is a way to consume
    responsibly and alleviate global poverty.

*Description:*
    Cultures as well as individuals continually balance the demands of
    nostalgia and sustainability as they construct historical narratives
    of ›futures worth preserving‹. The aim of this volume is to explore
    those narratives and the underlying assumptions which inform them.
    Drawing on a range of disciplines from the humanities and social
    sciences, the chapters investigate cultural assumptions about which
    aspects of the past deserve to be remembered and which aspects of
    the present should be sustained for the future. In the process, they
    reveal how contemporary definitions of sustainability are informed
    by a nostalgic yearning for the past, and how nostalgia is motivated
    by a reciprocal longing to sustain the past for the future.

    The Battle To Do Good : Inside McDonald’s Sustainability Journey
*Authors:*
    Bob Langert
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Bingley, UK : Emerald Publishing Limited. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In The Battle to Do Good, former McDonald's executive Bob Langert
    takes readers on a behind-the-scenes eye witness account of the mega
    brand's battle to address numerous societal hot-button issues, such
    as packaging, waste, recycling, obesity, deforestation, and animal
    welfare. From the late 80s, McDonald's landed smack in the middle of
    one contentious issue after another, often locking horns with
    powerful NGOs such as Greenpeace, People for the Ethical Treatment
    of Animals, and Corporate Accountability. This sudden shift from
    being the beloved Golden Arches since opening its doors in 1955, to
    the demon of many societal ills, caught McDonald's off guard.
    Langert chronicles the highs and lows that McDonald's experienced in
    turbulent times and how its sustainability journey evolved from
    playing defense to strategically solving issues with unlikely
    partners, including a whirling dervish, autistic animal scientist,
    and avid environmentalists from the World Wildlife Fund and
    Conservation International. Packed with first-hand anecdotes,
    interviews with key McDonald's executives and NGO leaders, and
    scores of lessons learned, The Battle to Do Good is a sustainability
    page turner that provides unique insights and guidance on how to
    successfully navigate and manage today's societal issues to make the
    business stronger, more relevant, and more profitable.

    Sustainability for the Nation: : Resource Connection and Governance

*Authors:*
    National Research Council (U.S.)
*Publication Information:*
    Washington District of Columbia : National Academies Press. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    A'sustainable society,'according to one definition,'is one that can
    persist over generations; one that is far-seeing enough, flexible
    enough, and wise enough not to undermine either its physical or its
    social system of support.'As the government sector works hard to
    ensure sufficient fresh water, food, energy, housing, health, and
    education for the nation without limiting resources for the future
    generations, it's clear that there is no sufficient organization to
    deal with sustainability issues. Each federal agency appears to have
    a single mandate or a single area of expertise making it difficult
    to tackle issues such as managing the ecosystem. Key resource
    domains, which include water, land, energy, and nonrenewable
    resources, for example, are nearly-completely connected yet
    different agencies exist to address only one aspect of these
    domains. The legendary ecologist John Muir wrote in 1911 that'when
    we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to
    everything else in the Universe.'Thus, in order for the nation to be
    successful in sustaining its resources,'linkages'will need to be
    built among federal, state, and local governments; nongovernmental
    organizations (NGOs); and the private sector. The National Research
    Council (NRC) was asked by several federal agencies, foundations,
    and the private sector to provide guidance to the federal government
    on issues related to sustainability linkages. The NRC assigned the
    task to as committee with a wide range of expertise in government,
    academia, and business. The committee held public fact-finding
    meetings to hear from agencies and stakeholder groups; examined
    sustainability management examples; conducted extensive literature
    reviews; and more to address the issue. Sustainability for the
    Nation: Resource Connection and Governance Linkages is the
    committee's report on the issue. The report includes insight into
    high-priority areas for governance linkages, the challenges of
    managing connected systems, impediments to successful government
    linkages, and more. The report also features examples of government
    linkages which include Adaptive Management on the Platte River,
    Philadelphia's Green Stormwater Infrastructure, and Managing Land
    Use in the Mojave.

    Life After Carbon : The Next Global Transformation of Cities
*Authors:*
    Peter Plastrik
    John Cleveland
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, DC : Island Press. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The future of our cities is not what it used to be. The modern-city
    model that took hold globally in the twentieth century has outlived
    its usefulness. It cannot solve the problems it helped to
    create—especially global warming. Fortunately, a new model for urban
    development is emerging in cities to aggressively tackle the
    realities of climate change. It transforms the way cities design and
    use physical space, generate economic wealth, consume and dispose of
    resources, exploit and sustain the natural ecosystems, and prepare
    for the future. In Life After Carbon, urban sustainability
    consultants Pete Plastrik and John Cleveland assemble this global
    pattern of urban reinvention from the stories of 25'innovation
    lab'cities across the globe—from Copenhagen to Melbourne. A city
    innovation lab is the entire city—the complex, messy, real urban
    world where innovations must work. It is a city in which government,
    business, and community leaders take to heart the challenge of
    climate change and converge on the radical changes that are
    necessary. They free downtowns from cars, turn buildings into
    renewable-energy power plants, re-nature entire neighborhoods,
    incubate growing numbers of clean-energy and smart-tech companies,
    convert waste to energy, and much more. Plastrik and Cleveland show
    that four transformational ideas are driving urban climate
    innovation around the world, in practice, not just in theory:
    carbon-free advantage, efficient abundance, nature's benefits, and
    adaptive futures. And these ideas are thriving in markets,
    professions, consumer trends, community movements, and'higher'levels
    of government that enable cities. Life After Carbon presents the new
    ideas that are replacing the pillars of the modern-city model,
    converting climate disaster into urban opportunity, and shaping the
    next transformation of cities worldwide. It will inspire anyone who
    cares about the future of our cities, and help them to map a
    sustainable path forward.

    From Sustainable to Resilient Cities : Global Concerns and Urban Efforts
*Series:*
    Research in Urban Sociology, volume 14
*Authors:*
    William G. Holt
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Bingley, UK : Emerald Group Publishing
    Limited. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The United Nations Brundtland Report defines sustainable development
    as one'that meets the needs of the present without compromising the
    ability of future generations to meet their own needs.'Embedded in
    this concept of sustainable development are the needs of the world's
    poor as well as the limits of environmental technology and social
    organizations to meet these needs. Urban centers, home to the
    majority of world's population, are hubs of sustainability
    innovations. However there are major differences among how these
    sustainability issues are addressed in the Global North and South.
    Increasingly, urban areas are moving from sustainability to
    resilience in dealing with environmental issues. This edited volume
    addresses sustainability efforts in cities and metropolitan regions
    around the world. The edition explores sustainable development
    across four key areas: environment, economic, sociopolitical, and
    cultural sustainability. These concepts are examined as they apply
    to both Global North and South urban areas. This volume includes
    chapters about applications to urban regions across the globe
    focusing on the movement from sustainable development to resilient
    urban centers.

*Title:*
    Rethinking Macroeconomics for Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Alejandro Nadal
*Publication Information:*
    London : Zed Books. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Macroeconomic policies have devastating effects on the environment.
    They shape the economic processes that drive deforestation, soil
    erosion, the exhaustion of living marine resources, greenhouse gas
    emissions, and the massive loss of biodiversity. Despite this, the
    vital connection between macroeconomic policies and the environment
    has thus far received little attention by the academic and the
    policy-making communities. Rethinking Macroeconomics for
    Sustainability reveals the linkages between monetary, financial and
    fiscal policies, and the environmental degradation that threatens
    the planet's biosphere. In doing so, it examines the complex lines
    of transmission from policy priorities all the way down to the
    effects at the local level, as well as analyzing the deep-seated
    relationship between macroeconomic policy models and their impacts
    on growth, peoples'livelihoods and the environment. Besides
    exploring the relation between macroeconomic and climate change
    policies, as well as efforts to'green'the world economy, the book
    considers five key case studies in Latin American economies. Going
    beyond this, it also sets out specific policy recommendations, both
    at the national and international levels. All this is based on the
    incontrovertible premise that macroeconomic policies must to be
    redesigned in order to attain long-term sustainability objectives,
    and that monetary and fiscal policies are as important for
    environmental stewardship as they are for growth and prosperity.

    The Top 50 Sustainability Books
*Authors:*
    Wayne Visser
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This unique title draws together in one volume some of the best
    thinking to date on the pressing social and environmental challenges
    we face as a society. These are the Top 50 Sustainability Books as
    voted for by the University of Cambridge Programme for
    Sustainability Leadership's alumni network of over 3,000 senior
    leaders from around the world. In addition to profiles of all 50
    titles, many of the authors share their most recent reflections on
    the state of the world and the ongoing attempts by business,
    government and civil society to create a more sustainable future.
    Many of these authors have become household names in the
    environmental, social and economic justice movements – from Rachel
    Carson, Ralph Nader and E.F. Schumacher to Vandana Shiva, Muhammad
    Yunus and Al Gore. Others, such as Aldo Leopold, Thomas Berry and
    Manfred Max-Neef, are relatively undiscovered gems, whose work
    should be much more widely known. By featuring these and other
    seminal thinkers, The Top 50 Sustainability Books distils a
    remarkable collective intelligence – one that provides devastating
    evidence of the problems we face as a global society, yet also
    inspiring examples of innovative solutions; it explores our deepest
    fears and our highest hopes for the future. It is a must-read for
    anyone who wants to tap into the wisdom of our age.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The agricultural scenario is rapidly changing with a host of
    challenges due to degradation of natural resources, climate change
    and socio economic factors on one hand and other hand with an
    emerging potential apportunities arising due to changing food
    preferences, increasing demand of secondary agriculture and enhanced
    access to domestic and international market. In view of this,
    agricultural extension has to be more vibrant to address the
    challenges and exploit potentialities by the concerned stakeholders.
    Realizing these requirements this book has been devised with five
    thematic areas 1. Rural youth and skill development, 2. Farming
    systems and approaches to sustainability, 3. Extension management
    and support for rural employability, 4. Management of agribusiness
    and 5. Gender empowerment and main streaming in which learned
    extension experts from all over India have contributed their
    experiences. We hope that the subject matter presented in this book
    will be helpful to Agricultural University students, researchers,
    extension personnel, farmers and others who concerned with these
    issue. Especially with the university students for their concern of
    this kind in social science can refer from this book.

    Urban Sustainability and Governance : New Changes in Nordic-Baltic
    Housing Policies
*Authors:*
    Holt-Jensen, Arild
    Pollock, Eric
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Urban sustainability and governance in relation to housing trends
    and policies is the focus of this book written by leading Nordic and
    Baltic housing researchers. The empricial examples are from the
    Baltic transition economies and the Nordic welfare states. For a
    number of reasons it is, however, of interest for researchers
    outside this region. Firstly, the global challenges of sustainable
    development and planning, presented in the theorectical section, are
    clarified and given a deeper practical meaning through the empirical
    chapters. The contrasts between the post-solicalist Baltic states
    and the social-democrat Nordic countries are in this context of
    special value. Secondly, the general challenges facing the
    post-socialist states are demonstrated in the housing development
    and policies evolving since 1991, as these integrate both social,
    economic and environmental issues. Thirdly, the book illustrates how
    path dependencies and former legacies influence present
    developments, which, contrary to common beliefs, differ between the
    5 Nordic and the 3 Baltic states. It is crucial reading for students
    and actors in planning and housing in the Baltic and Nordic states.
    The Nordic countries developed its post- WWII housing and welfare
    policies in the framework of a social-democrat egalitarian spirit
    resulting in co-ops dominating much of the scene in Norway,
    municipal housing companies in Sweden, nonprofit local housing
    associations in Denmark and housing with special state loans in
    Finland. In the same period Soviet state-socialist intentions formed
    the basis of large-scale uniform housing estates providing standard
    housing for the masses in the Baltic states. Privatisation in the
    east and increasing market liberalisation in the west have created
    new social cleavages on the housing scene. There are striking policy
    differences between the Nordic and Baltic states, but also
    smiliarities, both before the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, and
    in recent trends and challenges. The book provides a cruial common
    ground for reciporcal learning in the field of housing and planning.

*Description:*
    Contribution of renewable energy to human life is essential for
    sustainable life on Earth. The renewable energy industry is growing
    rapidly to fulfill the energy demand of the continuously developing
    world and has become the focal centre of many researchers across the
    globe. This development should meet the needs of the present without
    compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
    needs. Sustainable development ties together concerns for the
    carrying capacity of natural systems with the social challenges
    faced by humanity. This book is intended to highlight various
    aspects for applications of renewable energy and sustainability.
    This work is a collaborative attempt to elaborate useful technical
    information from many countries across the globe about the competent
    and effective use of renewable energy systems. This book presents
    theoretical and experimental analysis, case studies and models in
    renewable energy systems issues related to Solar Energy, Wind
    Energy, Bio Energy, Tidal Energy, Geothermal Energy, Fuel Cells, and
    Energy Storage Systems. This book also contains different
    considerations in order to develop products contributing to the
    sustainability of life.

    Bikki Jaggi
*Publication Information:*

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Accounting as an academic discipline has not made any real strides
    in addressing social and environmental concerns facing this planet.
    Since the first volume of the series was published in 2000, there
    have been no changes in the focus of accounting and it is still
    taught and practiced in the same way.
    Social/environmental/sustainability accounting is still a fringe
    subject despite the fact that ignoring environmental issues has
    serious consequences for the survival of this planet. Unless social
    and environmental accounting is formally recognized, firms will
    continue to view it as a means to convey information that enables
    them to manage their reputation without actually making any real
    efforts to improve the environment. The papers included in this
    volume discuss different aspects of sustainability, environmental
    performance, and environmental disclosures. Overall, it is fairly
    obvious from these papers that firms are aware of the impact of
    their activities on the environment. Some of the papers analyze what
    firms do about environmental issues and how these activities and
    their impact on the environment are disclosed in the financial
    statements. Though the papers come to different conclusions, it
    becomes clear from these studies that firms have problems in
    managing the impact of their environmental activities as well as in
    disclosing full and realistic information on these activities. Thus,
    it appears from these papers that firms manage their message to look
    good to outsiders.

    Critical Practices in Architecture : The Unexamined
*Series:*
    The Arts, Design and Culture in Cities
*Authors:*
    Bean, Jonathan
    Dickinson, Susannah
    Ida, Aletheia
    Rendell, Jane
*Publication Information:*
    Newcastle upon Tyne, UK : Cambridge Scholars Publishing. 2020
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book embraces the idea that in today's complex world, multiple,
    emerging perspectives are critical to the design fields, the
    environment, and society. It also brings authors into conversation
    to focus on the built environment from the perspective of critical
    practice. The authors take as a starting point Jane Rendell's
    ground-breaking work, which defines critical spatial practice as
    “self-reflective modes of thought that seek to change the world.” In
    opposition to conventional conceptions of architectural education
    and work, this book reflects how socially engaged architects,
    landscape architects, designers, urbanists, and artists take up
    critical spatial practice.Bridging ideas from multiple countries and
    approaches to design scholarship, each chapter seeks to find places
    of convergence for the multiple strands that form around themes of
    practice, equality, methods, theory, ethics, pedagogy, and
    representation. Rendell's foreword and postscript provide context
    for these themes and suggest a way forward in today's challenging,
    changing times.

    Leading Change Toward Sustainability : A Change-Management Guide for

*Authors:*
    Bob Doppelt
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *Updated 2nd ed. Sheffield, U.K. : Routledge. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    As the world struggles to cope with the growing threat of a global
    carbon crisis, Doppelt has revised one of the best books ever
    written about change management, leadership and sustainability to
    focus on de-carbonisation. Doppelt's research, presented in this
    hugely readable book, demystify the sustainability-change process by
    providing a theoretical framework and a methodology that managers
    can use to successfully transform their organisations to embrace
    sustainable development. Filled with case examples, interviews and
    checklists on how to move corporate and governmental cultures toward
    sustainability, the book argues that the key factors that facilitate
    change appear in the successful efforts at companies such as
    AstraZeneca, Nike, Starbucks, IKEA, Chiquita, Interface, Swisscom
    and Norm Thompson and in governmental efforts such as those in the
    Netherlands and Santa Monica in California. For these and other
    cutting-edge organisations, leading change is a philosophy for
    success. Leading Change toward Sustainability has been used by
    change leaders around the world to guide their internal global
    warming and sustainability organisational change initiatives. This
    new edition is essential reading for leaders from all types of
    organisations.

    Sustainability Indicators : A Scientific Assessment

*Authors:*
    Tomás Hák
    Bedrich Moldan
    Arthur Lyon Dahl
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, DC : Island Press. 2007
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    While the concept of sustainability has been widely embraced, it has
    been only vaguely defined and is exceedingly difficult to measure.
    Sustainability indicators are critical to making the broad concept
    of sustainability operational by providing specific measures by
    which decision makers and the public can judge progress.
    Sustainability Indicators defines the present state of the art in
    indicator development. It presents a comprehensive assessment of the
    science behind various indicators, while placing special emphasis on
    their use as communications tools. The contributors draw on their
    experience as academics and practitioners to describe the conceptual
    challenges to measuring something as complex as sustainability at
    local, regional, national, and global scales. The book also reviews
    existing indicators to assess how they could be better employed,
    considering which indicators are overused and which have been
    underutilized. Sustainability Indicators will help planners and
    policy makers find indicators that are ready for application and
    relevant to their needs, and will help researchers identify the
    unresolved issues where progress is most urgently needed. All
    readers will find advice as to the most effective ways to use
    indicators to support decision making.

*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Bingley : Emerald Group Publishing Limited. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Food insecurity can result from various events. When food is
    abundant, the entitlement to food is limited by endowments, the
    ability to trade, and potential transfers from family or the
    government. This volume utilizes a country and regional perspective
    to examine food insecurity. We consider the interaction between
    income and the share of household expenditures on food. The
    epidemiological risk assessment approach to food security issues is
    utilized as a function of agricultural and production, food
    distribution, and health policies. The interdependence of food
    security and climate change is examined. Overall trends in economic
    growth and poverty reduction, constraints and bottlenecks in
    agricultural productivity growth, regional trade agreements, and
    other influential policies are reviewed and discussed. We also
    consider food security as related to food consumption patterns and
    obesity. The role of income diversification as well as the impact of
    Farmer School Fields on food security are examined. The impact of
    inheritance and transfer entitlements is examined as we consider the
    role of remittances as well as'ganyu'or casual labor in determining
    food security.

    resource such as ores, oil, and most forms of energy. Natural
    resources management deals with managing the way in which people and
    natural landscapes interact. It brings together land use planning,
    water management, biodiversity conservation, and the future
    sustainability of industries like agriculture, mining, tourism,
    fisheries, and forestry. Wildlife conservation is in the practice of
    protecting endangered animal and plant species and their habitats.
    Among the goals of wildlife conservation are to ensure that nature
    will be around for future generations to enjoy and to recognize the
    importance of wildlife and wilderness lands to humans. This book
    will be really useful for environmentalists, researchers and
    wildlife conservators in taking some positive steps towards
    improving our environment and protects our resources for future
    generation.

*Description:*
    The critical appraisal of deforestation and the methods for such
    investigations have recently become important issues
    internationally. This book examines the socio-environmental
    relations and environmental changes in the African savanna.
    Socio-environmental relations in sub-Saharan Africa: the
    externalities of deforestation, floods, droughts, fires,
    socio-political upheavals, diseases and tribally, regionally
    relevant wars; still capture the headlines of the global media.
    However, Africa is still a continent dominated by farming and the
    socio-environmental externalities of this include forest border
    change and fragmentation, reactions to rainfall and associated
    results, urban markets and the implications of population change.
    These issues may be described as perennially relevant and
    under-investigated.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    World trade in agriculture, with its massive subsidies, restrictive
    barriers, international collaboration and competition, and the
    livelihoods of millions of farmers worldwide at stake, is an emotive
    subject that often provokes heated debate. So how can sustainability
    in agriculture be addressed whilst taking these issues into account?
    Sustainability in Agriculture presents an authoritative and balanced
    overview of many of the key factors that impact upon world
    agricultural practices. The aim is to throw light on the subject and
    so generate informed and rational discussion of the topics which so
    often generate powerful emotions. Fully referenced, and with sources
    of further reading given, the contributions from experts from around
    the globe cover: •Free trade •Fair and unfair trade •GM crops •The
    use of pesticides •Change in land use and sustainable development
    •Economic consequences of recent changes in the Common Agricultural
    Policy of the European Union A balanced analysis of risks and
    benefits is also provided, taking into account the economic and
    social impacts as well as the science of the novel practices
    discussed. The timeliness of this book, discussing as it does many
    hotly debated issues, make it essential reading for all those having
    an interest in the future of agriculture worldwide, but especially
    farmers and students of farming, environmental scientists,
    government agencies and policy makers. Cover image courtesy of

*Resource Type:*

*Description:*
    The recent global financial crisis has indicated that the
    conventional dominant paradigm in finance is unable to cope with the
    problems of financial systems, markets, and behaviour of financial
    institutions, and failed to understand the proper role of finance in
    society and the economic system as a whole. Drawing on the recent
    movements of corporate social responsibility, socially responsible
    investing and sustainable development, this volume goes further to
    examine the ongoing making of financial reality towards social
    responsibility and sustainability, and aims at a better
    understanding of finance as a collective construct and endeavour
    embedded in societal context. Bringing together leading scholarly
    thinking, this collection opens new avenues of comprehending
    corporate social responsibility, reveals mechanisms and strategies
    in shaping the reality of responsible finance, searches alternative
    approaches towards financial sustainability, and explores new
    thinking of coping with complex financial choice and financial
    risks. Moving away from the conventional financial paradigm, this
    volume demonstrates paradigm shifting in the financial world and
    provides fresh insights on how we may reshape the financial reality
    to enable societal betterment and prevent any future financial crisis.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The year 2015 will be a landmark year for international climate
    change negotiations. Governments have agreed to adopt a universal
    legal agreement on climate change at the 21st Conference of Parties
    (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
    (UNFCCC) in Paris in 2015. The agreement will come into force no
    later than 2020.This book focuses on the prospects for global
    agreement, how to encourage compliance with any such agreement and
    perspectives of key players in the negotiations — the United States,
    India, China, and the EU. It finds that there is strong commitment
    to the established UN institutions and processes within which the
    search for further agreed actions will occur. There are already a
    myriad of local and regional policies that are helping to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions and build mutual confidence. However, the
    chapters in the book also highlight potential areas of discord. For
    instance, varying interpretations of the “common but differentiated
    responsibilities” of developing countries, agreed as part of the
    UNFCCC, could be a major sticking point for negotiators. When
    combined with other issues, such as the choice of consumption or
    production as the basis for mitigation commitments, the appropriate
    time frame and base date for their measurement and whether level or
    intensity commitments are to be negotiated, the challenges that need
    to be overcome are considerable. The authors bring to bear insights
    from economics, public finance and game theory.

*Description:*
    In an era in which the individuality and vitality of small towns are
    under threat from globalization, and city planning discussions tend
    to center on topics like metropolitan regions, megaregions, and
    global cities, the authors of this volume see a need to reflect
    critically on the potential of small towns. They show how small
    towns can meet the challenge of a fast-paced, globalized world, and
    they use case studies to introduce movements, programs, and
    strategies capable of effectively promoting local cultures,
    traditions, identities, and sustainability. Small towns often play
    critical roles in regional economic systems. When small towns focus
    on their specific characteristics and take advantage of their
    opportunities, they can become stable niches within regional,
    national, and global economies and take on an important role in
    shaping a sustainable future. In einer Zeit, in der der Prozess der
    Globalisierung die Besonderheiten kleiner Städte und ihre Vitalität
    bedroht, und in der sich die meisten stadtplanerischen Diskussionen
    um Themen wie Metropolregionen oder Mega-Regionen und Weltstädte
    drehen, sehen die Autoren die Notwendigkeit, das Potenzial kleiner
    Ortschaften kritisch zu reflektieren. Sie veranschaulichen wie
    Kleinstädte die Herausforderung einer schnelllebigen und
    globalisierten Welt annehmen können, und stellen anhand von
    Fallbeispielen Bewegungen, Programme und Strategien vor, die
    örtliche Kulturen, Traditionen, Identitäten und Nachhaltigkeit
    effektiv zu fördern wissen. Kleinstädte spielen oftmals eine
    entscheidende Rolle innerhalb regionaler Wirtschaftssysteme. Wenn
    Kleinstädte sich auf ihre spezifischen Eigenschaften konzentrieren
    und ihre Möglichkeiten nutzen, können sie zu stabilen Nischen in
    regionalen, nationalen und globalen Ökonomien werden und wesentlich
    dazu beitragen, eine nachhaltige Zukunft zu gestalten.

    A Global Assessment of Offshore Mariculture Potential From a Spatial

    FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper, Vol. 549
*Authors:*

*Publication Information:*
    Rome : FAO. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This publication was produced in recognition that there is a growing
    need to increasingly transfer land-based/coastal aquaculture
    production systems further offshore as a result of the expected
    increases in human population, competition for access to land and
    clean water needed to increase the availability of fish and fishery
    products much needed for human consumption. Mariculture, in
    particular offshore, offers significant opportunities for
    sustainable food production and development of many coastal
    communities, especially in regions where the availability of land,
    near shore space and freshwater are limited. This publication
    provides, for the first time, measures of the status and potential
    for offshore mariculture development from a spatial perspective that
    are comprehensive of all maritime nations and comparable among them.
    It also identifies nations that are not yet practicing mariculture
    that have a high offshore potential. The underlying purpose of this
    document is to stimulate interest for detailed assessments of
    offshore mariculture potential at national levels. Remote sensing
    for the sustainable development of offshore mariculture is included
    as Annex 3 to this publication in recognition of the importance of
    remote sensing as a source of data for spatial analyses to assess
    potential for offshore mariculture, and also for zoning and site
    selection as well as for operational remote sensing to aid
    mariculture management.

*Authors:*
    Huong Ha
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. New York : Business Expert Press. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Change management is a challenging and continuous process that
    requires a particular skill set for both leaders and managers. It is
    essential for leaders and change agents to understand and address
    the five most important questions: Why? What? Who? How? When?
    Inside, you'll learn the concept of change management, its impact on
    the company's business performance and sustainability, and the
    relevant issues associated with it. The author highlights the
    importance of sustainable development, including economic,
    environmental, and social elements and introduces different types of
    changes including planned, unplanned, incremental/marginal,
    transitional, and transformational ones. Various models of planned
    and unplanned changes are featured, including leaders as change
    agents; the concept of resistance, reasons, sources, and forms of
    resistance to change; definitions of values, attitudes,
    personalities, and perceptions of individuals; and how these
    determinants affect individuals'behaviors, attitudes, and responses
    toward organizational change. Several organizational examples are
    provided throughout the book to illustrate how high-performance
    organizations grow their business.

    Sustainability : A Philosophy of Adaptive Ecosystem Management
*Authors:*
    Bryan G. Norton
*Publication Information:*
    Chicago : University of Chicago Press. 2005
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    While many disciplines contribute to environmental conservation,
    there is little successful integration of science and social values.
    Arguing that the central problem in conservation is a lack of
    effective communication, Bryan Norton shows in Sustainability how
    current linguistic resources discourage any shared,
    multidisciplinary public deliberation over environmental goals and
    policy. In response, Norton develops a new, interdisciplinary
    approach to defining sustainability—the cornerstone of environmental
    policy—using philosophical and linguistic analyses to create a
    nonideological vocabulary that can accommodate scientific and
    evaluative environmental discourse. Emphasizing cooperation and
    adaptation through social learning, Norton provides a practical
    framework that encourages an experimental approach to language
    clarification and problem formulation, as well as an
    interdisciplinary approach to creating solutions. By moving beyond
    the scientific arena to acknowledge the importance of public
    discourse, Sustainability offers an entirely novel approach to
    environmentalism.

*Title:*
    Sustainable Cities : Local Solutions in the Global South
*Authors:*
    Robertson, Mélanie
*Publication Information:*
    Warwickshire, UK : IDRC. 2012
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    As urbanization, environmental degradation, and poverty become
    increasingly urgent problems, understanding the links between
    sustainability and poverty reduction is imperative. A sustainable
    urban future for all requires raising the quality of life of the
    most vulnerable. Existing at the margins of urban life, low-income
    residents of cities in the global south are subject to numerous
    environmental burdens and are too often excluded from mainstream
    development and planning. In the face of these challenges,
    communities have proven to be remarkably resilient and innovative,
    with tremendous potential both to improve the quality of their own
    habitat and to contribute to the development of healthy and
    productive cities. The research presented in this book attempts to
    show how this potential can be harnessed, by showcasing sustainable
    solutions developed by the urban poor themselves. The book's diverse
    case studies present the findings of participatory action research
    projects funded by IDRC's ECOPOLIS Graduate Research and Design
    Awards in urban poverty. The studies, conducted in the growing urban
    and peri-urban areas of Peru, Senegal, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, the
    Philippines, Thailand, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, outline
    concrete strategies for sustainable urban living and design,
    developed in partnership with low-income city dwellers. The book
    offers insights into both theory and practice, which will be useful
    and inspiring to students, researchers, development practitioners,
    and policy-makers alike.

    The Sustainability Curriculum : The Challenge for Higher Education
*Authors:*
    Cedric Cullingford
    John Blewitt
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2004
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The links between education and sustainable development are
    deepening, although subject to much controversy and debate. The
    success of the sustainability discourse depends both on the
    pedagogic and research functions of higher education. Similarly, for
    higher education itself to remain relevant and engaged it faces
    pressure not only to integrate the insights and lessons drawn from
    the perspective of sustainable development, but also to be
    responsive to scrutiny of its own practices in relation to
    sustainability. Among professionals in higher education, sustainable
    development has its supporters and detractors. It is embraced by
    some individuals and departments while being perceived by others as
    a threat to the coherence of particular disciplines. Although it is
    not currently an academic discipline in its own right, increasing
    public and professional familiarity with the term, and the
    increasing urgency of global calls for the implementation of
    sustainable development mean that this is rapidly changing. This
    volume analyses the impact of the concepts and practices of
    sustainability and sustainable development on various academic
    disciplines, institutional practices, fields of study and methods of
    enquiry. The contributors, drawn from a wide-range of disciplines,
    perspectives, educational levels and institutional contexts, examine
    the purpose of the modern university and the nature of sustainable
    education, which includes exploring links to social movements for
    sustainability projects, curriculum change, culture and
    biodiversity, values relating to gender equality and global
    responsibility, and case studies on the transformation, or
    otherwise, of some specific disciplines.

    Sustainability and the Design of Transport Interchanges
*Authors:*
    Brian Edwards
*Publication Information:*
    Abingdon, Oxon : Routledge. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The interchange is a new form of transport building which integrates
    into a single whole various modes of public transport, putting the
    passenger first (rather than the infrastructure). This book presents
    design principles for transport interchanges and offers analysis of
    best practice in the UK and abroad. The author demonstrates how this
    complex new building type integrates with the city, on the one hand,
    and with different types of transport on the other. In this
    integration design in both plan and section are important, as is
    urban and landscape design. The idea of ‘interchange'is increasingly
    relevant as town planners, engineers and architects address the
    question of sustainable development with its emphasis on energy
    efficiency, social cohesion, access for the elderly, and urban
    regeneration.

*Authors:*
    Simon Dresner
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *2nd ed. London : Routledge. 2008
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    At a time of increasingly rapid environmental deterioration and
    climate change, sustainability is one of the most important issues
    facing the world. Can we create a sustainable society? What would
    that mean? How should we set about doing it? How can we bring about
    such a profound change in the way things are organized? This text
    tackles these questions directly. It covers: historical development
    of the concept of sustainability; contemporary debates about how to
    achieve it; and obstacles and the prospects for overcoming them.
    This new fully revised edition covers the latest on the climate
    change front, particularly the advances in scientific understanding
    and political awareness of climate change. Other updates include
    more recent economic analyses, particularly the Stern Report, and
    the global shift away from faith in markets over the past five years.

*Description:*
    Sustainability challenges blur the boundaries between academic
    disciplines, between research, policy and practice, and between
    states, markets and society. What do exemplary scientists and
    organisations do to bridge the gaps between these groups and help
    their research to make the greatest impact? How do they do it? And
    how can their best practices be adapted for a diverse range of
    specific sustainability challenges? Enhancing Science Impact:
    Bridging Research, Policy and Practice for Sustainability addresses
    these questions in an accessible and engaging way. It provides
    principles explaining how research programs can work more
    effectively across the boundaries between science, society and
    decision-making by building social and institutional networks. The
    book suggests useful ways of thinking about a diverse range of
    problems and then offers five approaches to help embed science in
    sustainability governance. It will be an indispensable guide for
    researcher leaders, science program managers and science policy
    advisers interested in ensuring that applied research can
    meaningfully contribute to sustainability outcomes.

    Can Business Save the Earth? : Innovating Our Way to Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Michael Lenox
    Aaron Chatterji
*Publication Information:*
    Stanford, California : Stanford Business Books. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Increasingly, business leaders are tasked with developing new
    products, services, and business models that minimize environmental
    impact while driving economic growth. It's a tall order—and a call
    that is only getting louder. In Can Business Save the Earth?,
    Michael Lenox and Aaron Chatterji explain just how the private
    sector can help. Many believe that markets will inevitably demand
    sustainable practices and force them to emerge. But Lenox and
    Chatterji see it differently. Based on more than a decade of
    research and work with companies, they argue that a bright green
    future is only possible with dramatic innovation across multiple
    sectors at the same time. To achieve this, a broader ecosystem of
    players—including inventors, executives, customers, investors,
    activists, and governments—all must play a role. The book outlines
    how and the extent to which each group can serve as a driver of
    green growth. Then, Lenox and Chatterji identify where economic
    incentives currently exist, or could exist with institutional
    change, and ultimately address the larger question of how far
    well-coordinated efforts can take us in addressing the current
    environmental crisis.

    Social Sustainability in Urban Areas : Communities, Connectivity and

    Judith Allen
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This groundbreaking new volume on social sustainability offers both
    critique and creative solutions. It challenges the conventional
    wisdoms of social sustainability and presents practical examples of
    projects that will help practitioners to think carefully and
    innovatively about the situations they are addressing. The book
    consists of original contributions from academics working in the
    fields of urban planning, housing, regeneration, transport and
    international sustainable development. Drawing on case study
    research gathered in the UK, Europe and Africa, it adopts an
    original, interdisciplinary approach to both theory and practice,
    illustrating the challenges and opportunities facing policy-makers
    and practitioners attempting to develop, manage and maintain
    sustainable communities. The authors argue that the dominant
    approach of'how to do'small scale social sustainability fails to
    locate it within broader social processes. Ignoring the context not
    only sustains, but also actively reproduces wider inequalities. The
    book presents a new, more coherent and more complete approach to
    issues of social sustainability in urban areas. The book approaches
    current urban policy discourses in three different ways, represented
    by three sections: firstly focusing on small places within the urban
    fabric, secondly addressing the whole urban fabric by examining
    whether changing urban living and working patterns. The third
    section explores some of the ways that funding can be secured to
    achieve the aims of social sustainability and the social planning
    associated with it.

*Description:*
    What we make and buy is a major indicator of society's collective
    priorities. Among twenty-four key trends, Vital Signs Volume 22
    explores significant global patterns in production and consumption.
    The result is a fascinating snapshot of how we invest our resources
    and the implications for the world's well-being. The book examines
    developments in six main areas: energy, environment and climate,
    transportation, food and agriculture, global economy and resources,
    and population and society. Readers will learn how aquaculture is
    making gains on wild fish catches, where high speed rail is
    accelerating, why plastic production is on the rise, who is escaping
    chronic hunger, and who is still suffering. Researchers at the
    Worldwatch Institute not only provide the most up-to-date
    statistics, but put them in context. The analysis in Vital
    Signs teaches us both about our current priorities and how they
    could be shaped to create a better future.

    Organizing Supply Chain Processes for Sustainable Innovation in the

    Raffaella Cagliano
    Frederico Caniato

*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Bingley, UK : Emerald Group Publishing
    Limited. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The sustainability of agri-food supply chains is particularly
    relevant for global sustainable development. Many existing food
    production systems do more harm than good. They compromise the
    natural rhythms of the Earth, introduce toxins, and therefore
    sacrifice future capability for current demands – the opposite of
    sustainable development norms. The existing system is also
    unbalanced with respect to its capacity to produce, the amount of
    waste it generates, the number of people who suffer from hunger, and
    the nutritional value it provides. Most of the current supply chains
    have been developed within the classic economic paradigm, where
    scale and leverage drive choices towards more profitable models. As
    a consequence, finding new ways to produce, distribute and consume
    food is a morale, financial, and environmental necessity.
    Sustainable development and triple bottom line perspectives provide
    the logic for questioning this paradigm. This book presents and
    discusses nine cases of organizational innovation in food supply
    chain, covering different phases of food production, facing
    different challenges, and proposing different solutions to the
    challenge of sustainable food development.

*Description:*
    In 2008, Ashoka launched the'Changemaker Campus Initiative'which
    applies Ashoka's rigorous criteria to select and support
    universities as they develop and implement a comprehensive social
    entrepreneurship plan. Through the lessons learned from this
    network, and with input from its broader global network of those
    experienced in the field, Ashoka aims to set a new standard for
    social entrepreneurship education. Indeed, despite the rising
    demand, there remains a dire need for quality coursework and global
    teaching case studies. Social entrepreneurs – and the pressing
    challenges they solve – are not bound by geographic borders or a
    single political environment, yet there is a lack of the materials
    necessary to equip students with the skills and mind-set required to
    catalyze systemic social change. What few high-quality case studies
    do exist typically highlight social entrepreneurs within the United
    States. This cooperation with oikos within the Social
    Entrepreneurship Track of the annual oikos Global Case Competition
    is a critical vehicle for tackling that challenge. As a result of
    this effort, more locally relevant case studies are being written,
    peer-reviewed, and judged than ever before, and are able to make
    their way into the hands of global audiences eager to adopt them
    into their courses. Building social entrepreneurship skills and
    problem-solving abilities are best practiced and honed using
    real-life examples and strategic challenges – not just learning
    theories in a vacuum. Case studies provide this exposure and
    real-time training in systemic problem-solving. Through these 15
    teaching cases, students learn that social entrepreneurship is about
    identifying root causes of problems and applying a solution that
    tackles the system. As study upon study has shown, the band-aid
    approach does not work. To effectively address a social problem, the
    solution must continually adapt and evolve based on market feedback
    about what works and what needs to change in the model. Case Studies
    in Social Entrepreneurship and Sustainability is the second volume
    resulting from the oikos Global Case Writing Competition – an annual
    program launched in 2003 to promote the publication of high-quality
    teaching cases in corporate sustainability. This book expands the
    collection with award-winning global cases in the rapidly growing
    field of social entrepreneurship and sustainability. In view of the
    growing importance of various sustainability trends, management
    schools are increasingly challenged to adapt their entrepreneurship
    and business curricula. Management education needs to reflect the
    trends and provide a broadened understanding of value creation.
    Sustainability is a concept that demands that organizations consider
    the legitimate expectations of different stakeholders in their value
    creation processes. At the same time, it underlines the fact that
    many sustainability trends offer new business opportunities that
    entrepreneurs will seize. As a result, value creation processes need
    to be reorganized in order to create economic capital while
    developing social capital and preserving natural capital. Indeed,
    entrepreneurial organizations are increasingly dealing with these
    challenges. The case studies in this book explore both the
    opportunities and pitfalls entrepreneurs – working with
    organizations with for-profit, hybrid and non-profit business models
    – face in targeting sustainability issues and how their values and
    core assumptions impact their business strategies. They describe new
    patterns of value creation, new alliances, and the challenges of
    dealing with existing paradigms. It is clear that new ways of doing
    business with a common objective of maximizing social impact are
    substantially shaping markets and society. This textbook of
    competition-winning case studies for management education in the
    field of social entrepreneurship and sustainability provides
    excellent learning opportunities, tel

    State of the World 2013 : Is Sustainability Still Possible?
*Series:*
    State of the World 2013, Vol. 2013
*Authors:*
    The Worldwatch Institute
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, DC : Island Press. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Every day, we are presented with a range of “sustainable” products
    and activities—from “green” cleaning supplies to carbon offsets—but
    with so much labeled as “sustainable,” the term has become
    essentially sustainababble, at best indicating a practice or product
    slightly less damaging than the conventional alternative. Is it time
    to abandon the concept altogether, or can we find an accurate way to
    measure sustainability? If so, how can we achieve it? And if not,
    how can we best prepare for the coming ecological decline? In the
    latest edition of Worldwatch Institute's State of the World series,
    scientists, policy experts, and thought leaders tackle these
    questions, attempting to restore meaning to sustainability as more
    than just a marketing tool. In State of the World 2013: Is
    Sustainability Still Possible?, experts define clear sustainability
    metrics and examine various policies and perspectives, including
    geoengineering, corporate transformation, and changes in
    agricultural policy, that could put us on the path to prosperity
    without diminishing the well-being of future generations. If these
    approaches fall short, the final chapters explore ways to prepare
    for drastic environmental change and resource depletion, such as
    strengthening democracy and societal resilience, protecting cultural
    heritage, and dealing with increased conflict and migration flows.
    State of the World 2013 cuts through the rhetoric surrounding
    sustainability, offering a broad and realistic look at how close we
    are to fulfilling it today and which practices and policies will
    steer us in the right direction. This book will be especially useful
    for policymakers, environmental nonprofits, and students of
    environmental studies, sustainability, or economics.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The search for answers to the issue of global sustainability has
    become increasingly urgent. In the context of higher education, many
    universities and academics are seeking new insights that can shift
    our dependence on ways of living that rely on the exploitation of so
    many and the degradation of so much of our planet. This is the
    vision that drives SANORD and many of the researchers and
    institutions within its network. Although much of the research is on
    a relatively small scale, the vision is steadily gaining momentum,
    forging dynamic collaborations and pathways to new knowledge. The
    contributors to this book cover a variety of subject areas and offer
    fresh insights about chronically under-researched parts of the
    world. Others document and critically reflect on innovative
    approaches to cross-continental teaching and research
    collaborations. This book will be of interest to anyone involved in
    the transformation of higher education or the practicalities of
    cross-continental and cross-disciplinary academic collaboration. The
    Southern African-Nordic Centre (SANORD) is a network of higher
    education institutions from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway,
    Sweden, Botswana, Namibia, Malawi, South Africa, Zambia and
    Zimbabwe. Universities in the southern African and Nordic regions
    that are not yet members are encouraged to join.

*Description:*
    “Good books make important points because their authors have
    something worthwhile to say. This book is more than a good book
    because its authors not only make important points but they do so in
    ways that exemplify the transdisciplinarity the authors write about.
    In eight interesting and insightful chapters the book connects
    pedagogy, marketing, development, immanence, race, resilience,
    technology, and the commons in ways that show the necessity and
    importance of transdisciplinary thinking. This is a book for those
    who seek deeper and more creative connections to a sustainable way
    of life, a way of life that opens up imaginative acts of hope.”—John

    Sustainability And Cities: Concept And Assessment
*Authors:*
    Giok Ling Ooi
*Publication Information:*
    Singapore : World Scientific / Inst Of Policy Studies, S'pore. 2005
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This important book addresses issues of development and its
    environmental sustainability for the fastest growing areas in Asia —
    its cities. Recognizing sustainability with respect to the
    environment and its exploitation has yet to make its impact on
    development plans in Asia. The problem is due to the lack of
    cross-country studies, which provide a fair understanding of the
    different levels of development, as well as the wide variety of
    development strategies adopted by different countries. The
    relatively ineffective implementation of environmental assessment
    has not done much to reduce the damage to, or depletion of, the
    natural resource base.Sustainability and Cities: Concept and
    Assessment aims to bridge this gap by taking a sober look at the
    translation of concepts of environmental sustainability into terms
    that are meaningful and applicable for cities, particularly those in
    fast-developing countries like China.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainable development--meeting human needs while nurturing and
    restoring the planet's life support systems--requires a continuous
    process of scientific innovation, new knowledge and learning, and
    collaborative approaches to implementing technologies and policies.
    To address these challenges, different stakeholder groups are
    increasingly seeking to ally themselves through partnership, in
    order to implement projects, deliver services, establish secure
    funding mechanisms, and achieve on the ground results. Advocates of
    this collaborative approach point to the failure of governmental
    regulations, international commitments, or business as usual.
    However, skeptics often question the effectiveness of partnerships
    at achieving sustainable development goals and, in the absence of
    demonstrated results, wonder where partnerships are adding value. A
    symposium held in June 2008 and summarized in this volume, attempted
    to advance the dialogue on partnerships for sustainability in order
    to catalyze existing knowledge and inform future efforts. Ideas that
    came out of discussions at the symposium will help leaders in
    government, the private sector, foundations and NGOs, and
    universities, both in the United States and internationally, as they
    develop and participate in new partnerships for sustainability.

*Description:*
    Higher Education Institutions in a Global Warming World aims to
    contribute to the global debate on sustainability in higher
    education, and in particular to the transition of higher education
    institutions to a low carbon economy. The transition of higher
    education institutions towards a low carbon economy is aligned with
    the Paris Agreement and with Sustainable Development Goal 13: Take
    urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It is also
    consistent with the European Commission's climate strategies and
    targets and with the aims of the European Climate Change Program.
    Transitioning to a low carbon economy represents one of the most
    significant and urgent challenges we are facing, and universities
    have a critical role to play in fostering a low carbon future,
    especially by developing innovative solutions. This book intends to
    be a contribution to this discussion about sustainability in higher
    education.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    We think we understand environmental damage: pollution, water
    scarcity, a warming world. But these problems are just the tip of
    the iceberg. Food insecurity, financial assets drained of value by
    environmental damage, and a rapid rise in diseases of animal
    origin are among the underreported consequences of an unsustainable
    global system. In State of the World 2015, the flagship publication
    of The Worldwatch Institute, experts explore hidden threats to
    sustainability and how to address them. How will nations deal with
    migration as climate change refugees cross borders in order to
    escape flooding, drought, or other extreme weather events? What will
    happen to the price and availability of fossil energy—the foundation
    of industrial civilization--as these resources oscillate between
    surplus and scarcity? If perpetual economic growth on a finite
    planet is impossible, what are the alternatives? Can national
    governments manage the transition? Eight key issues are addressed in
    depth, along with the central question of how we can develop
    resilience to these and other shocks. For decades, The Worldwatch
    Institute has been a leader in identifying and analyzing emerging
    environmental threats. With the latest edition of State of The
    World, the authorities at Worldwatch bring to light challenges we
    can no longer afford to ignore.

    The Community Resilience Reader : Essential Resources for an Era of
    Upheaval
*Authors:*
    Daniel Lerch
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, DC : Island Press. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The sustainability challenges of yesterday have become today's
    resilience crises. National and global efforts have failed to stop
    climate change, transition from fossil fuels, and reduce inequality.
    We must now confront these and other increasingly complex problems
    by building resilience at the community level. But what does that
    mean in practice, and how can it be done in a way that's effective
    and equitable? The Community Resilience Reader offers a new vision
    for creating resilience, through essays by leaders in such varied
    fields as science, policy, community building, and urban design. The
    Community Resilience Reader combines a fresh look at the challenges
    humanity faces in the 21st century, the essential tools of
    resilience science, and the wisdom of activists, scholars, and
    analysts working with community issues on the ground. It shows that
    resilience is a process, not a goal; how resilience requires
    learning to adapt but also preparing to transform; and that
    resilience starts and ends with the people living in a community.
    Despite the formidable challenges we face, The Community Resilience
    Reader shows that building strength and resilience at the community
    level is not only crucial, but possible. From Post Carbon Institute,
    the producers of the award-winning The Post Carbon Reader, The
    Community Resilience Reader is a valuable resource for students,
    community leaders, and concerned citizens.

*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2003
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Environmental activists and academics alike are realizing that a
    sustainable society must be a just one. Environmental degradation is
    almost always linked to questions of human equality and quality of
    life. Throughout the world, those segments of the population that
    have the least political power and are the most marginalized are
    selectively victimized by environmental crises. This book argues
    that social and environmental justice within and between nations
    should be an integral part of the policies and agreements that
    promote sustainable development. The book addresses the links
    between environmental quality and human equality and between
    sustainability and environmental justice.

    The Designer's Atlas of Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Ann Thorpe
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, DC : Island Press. 2007
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Designing for sustainability is an innovation shaping both the
    design industry and design education today.Yet architects, product
    designers, and other key professionals in this new field have so far
    lacked a resource that addresses their sensibilities and concerns.
    The Designer's Atlas of Sustainability now explores the basic
    principles, concepts, and practice of sustainable design in a
    visually sophisticated and engaging style. The book tackles not only
    the ecological aspects of sustainable design-designers'choice of
    materials and manufacturing processes have a tremendous impact on
    the natural world-but also the economic and cultural elements
    involved. The Atlas is neither a how-to manual nor collection of
    recipes for sustainable design, but a compendium of fresh approaches
    to sustainability that designers can incorporate into daily thinking
    and practice. Illuminating many facets of this exciting field, the
    book offers ideas on how to harmonize human and natural systems, and
    then explores practical options for making the business of design
    more supportive of long-term sustainability. An examination of the
    ethical dimensions of sustainable development in our public and
    private lives is the theme present throughout. Like other kinds of
    atlases, The Designer's Atlas of Sustainability illustrates its
    subject, but it goes far beyond its visual appeal, stimulating
    design solutions for'development that cultivates environmental and
    social conditions that will support human well-being indefinitely.'

    Rethinking Sustainability : Power, Knowledge, and Institutions
*Series:*
    Evolving Values For A Capitalist World
*Authors:*
    Jonathan Mark Harris
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *1st pbk. ed. Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press. 2003
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Bringing together the thoughts of economists, political scientists,
    anthropologists, philosophers, and agricultural policy
    professionals, this volume focuses on the issues of sustainability
    in development. Examining such topics as international trade,
    political power, gender roles, legal institutions, and agricultural
    research, the contributors focus on the missing links in theory and
    practice that have been barriers to the achievement of truly
    sustainable development. Any theory of sustainable development must
    take into account economic, social, and environmental dimensions.
    Until recently, the question'What is development?'was often answered
    predominantly from the economist's perspective, with high priority
    being assigned to expansion of economic output. Social, political,
    institutional, and ethical aspects have often been neglected. But
    now that sustainable development has become a broadly accepted
    concept, it is impossible to maintain a narrowly economistic view of
    development. For this reason, the varied perspectives offered by the
    contributors to this volume are crucial to understanding the process
    of development as it relates to environmental sustainability and
    human well-being. The selection of articles is meant to be
    stimulating and provocative rather than comp-rehensive. They are
    roughly divided between those dealing with broad theoretical issues
    concerning the economic, political, and social aspects of
    development (Part I) and those presenting more applied analysis
    (Part II). The common thread is a concern for examining which
    factors contribute to making development socially just and
    environmentally sound. Rethinking Sustainability will be of interest
    to economists and social scientists, development professionals, and
    instructors seeking to offer their students a broad perspective on
    development issues. Jonathan Harris is Senior Research Associate,
    Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University, as
    well as Adjunct Associate Professor of International Economics at
    Tufts University Fletcher School of Law.

    The Role of Legal Compliance in Sustainable Supply Chains,

*Series:*
    Environmental and Social Sustainability for Business Advantage
    Collection
*Authors:*
    John D. Wood
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. New York, New York [222 East 46th Street, New
    York, NY 10017] : Business Expert Press. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainability is a global megatrend with ramifications across all
    functional areas of business. This book addresses an underdeveloped
    topic in the field of sustainable business—the use of corporate
    resources dedicated to legal compliance. In order to comply with the
    law, supply chain, operations, and marketing professionals must know
    what the applicable legal frameworks are. In order to promote
    sustainable business, these same professionals must go beyond mere
    compliance with these laws. This book will assist you in both
    respects by (1) offering concise discussions of the primary legal
    frameworks governing the social, economic, and environmental
    dimensions of supply chain management, operations management, and
    marketing; and (2) making the business case for going beyond mere
    compliance with legal requirements. Written by an expert in
    environmental law and public policy, this book argues that companies
    that go beyond mere compliance with social, economic, and
    environmental safeguards inherent in legal regimes will capture
    greater benefits and incur fewer risks from their supply chain,
    operations, and marketing activities.

    Seattle and the Roots of Urban Sustainability : Inventing Ecotopia
*Series:*
    History of the Urban Environment
*Authors:*
    Jeffrey Craig Sanders
*Publication Information:*
    Pittsburgh, Pa : University of Pittsburgh Press. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Seattle, often called the “Emerald City,” did not achieve its green,
    clean, and sustainable environment easily. This thriving ecotopia is
    the byproduct of continuing efforts by residents, businesses, and
    civic leaders alike. In Seattle and the Roots of Urban
    Sustainability, Jeffrey Craig Sanders examines the rise of
    environmental activism in Seattle amidst the “urban crisis” of the
    1960s and its aftermath. Like much activism during this period, the
    environmental movement began at the grassroots level—in local
    neighborhoods over local issues. Sanders links the rise of local
    environmentalism to larger movements for economic, racial, and
    gender equality and to a counterculture that changed the social and
    political landscape. He examines emblematic battles that erupted
    over the planned demolition of Pike Place Market, a local landmark,
    and environmental organizing in the Central District during the War
    on Poverty. Sanders also relates the story of Fort Lawton, a
    decommissioned army base, where Audubon Society members and Native
    American activists feuded over future land use. The rise and
    popularity of environmental consciousness among Seattle's residents
    came to influence everything from industry to politics, planning,
    and global environmental movements. Yet, as Sanders reveals, it was
    in the small, local struggles that urban environmental activism began.

    Trade, Globalization and Sustainability Impact Assessment : A
    Critical Look at Methods and Outcomes
*Authors:*
    Paul Ekins
    Tancrede Voituriez
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Trade liberalization, as promoted by the World Trade Organization
    (WTO), has become one of the dominant drivers and most controversial
    aspects of globalization. Trade sustainability impact assessments
    (SIAs) were introduced as a means of generating better understanding
    especially of the social and environmental impacts of trade
    liberalisation, and of making those impacts more consistent with
    sustainable development. This book takes a hard look at the
    experience of Trade SIAs to date, and the extent to which they have
    achieved their objectives and improved the outcomes of trade
    negotiations. It proposes several ways in which Trade SIAs could be
    made more effective, and illustrates these in respect of
    controversial sectors in which trade liberalisation has been
    implemented or proposed, including commodities, services and
    investment. Finally the book makes proposals beyond SIA through
    which some of the conflicts between trade liberalization and
    sustainable development could be more effectively addressed. Written
    by top researchers and experts on trade SIAs, this book is vital for
    researchers, academics, post-graduate students and policy makers
    working on any aspect of impact assessment, international trade or
    globalisation more generally. In addition, the book will provide a
    particularly useful background for those considering how the
    environment and trade interrelate at both global and regional
    levels, with some particular insights on climate change and trade
    policies.

*Description:*
    A new world based on fairness, participation, accountability is
    closer than you thinkif you learn to think like a commoner The
    biggest'tragedy of the commons'is the misconception that commons are
    failures-relics from another era rendered unnecessary by the Market
    and State. Think Like a Commoner dispels such prejudices by
    explaining the rich history and promising future of the commons-an
    ageless paradigm of cooperation and fairness that is re-making our
    world. With graceful prose and dozens of fascinating stories,
    Bollier describes the quiet revolution that is pioneering practical
    forms of self-governance and production controlled by people

    Sustainability and the Civil Commons : Rural Communities in the Age
    of Globalization
*Authors:*
    Sumner, Jennifer
*Publication Information:*
    Toronto [Ont.] : University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing
    Division. 2007
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Often used but little understood, the word ‘sustainability'is potent
    in its ability to evoke a better world based on economic, social,
    and environmental justice. The concept of sustainability, however,
    has been strikingly under-theorized. Sustainability and the Civil
    Commons provides what has been lacking since the publication of the
    Brundtland Report – a firm foundation and a clear vision of
    alternatives.Using rural communities as her reference-point,
    Jennifer Sumner exposes the unsustainable impacts of corporate
    globalization, and develops a framework to explain why current
    definitions of sustainability are profoundly inadequate. From this
    foundation, she allies sustainability with the concept of the civil
    commons – including universal healthcare, environmental protocols,
    workplace safety regulations, and public education – demonstrating
    how globalizing the civil commons, not corporate-sponsored trade
    treaties, opens the way for truly ‘sustainable globalization'.
    Sustainability and the Civil Commons moves beyond rural roots
    through Antonio Gramsci's model of hegemony, Jürgen Habermas's
    theory of communicative action, and John McMurtry's life-value
    ethics to build a comprehensive understanding of sustainability that
    combines global reach with local focus. It will be an invaluable
    resource for scholars and practitioners interested in
    sustainability, globalization, community development, and rural studies.

    Futureproof Competition Law
*Authors:*
    Gerbrandy, Anna
*Publication Information:*
    Netherlands : Eleven International Publishing. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The need to change towards a sustainable economy has propelled
    companies to collaborate in sustainability initiatives. Such
    initiatives, however, might be held against European competition
    law. This poses the question: can competition law be rebalanced so
    as to provide room for sustainability initiatives? In her inaugural
    lecture, author Anna Gerbrandy argues that European competition law
    cannot remain isolated from broader societal considerations. To
    retain its legitimacy, competition law needs to respond to the
    changed societal situation. This argument is based on an insightful
    account of the changing roles of the State and the market in
    providing for the public interest. Set against the backdrop of
    globalisation and the need for a sustainable society, it is argued
    that companies and civil society also have an important role to
    play. The author does not shy away from moral questions of fairness,
    and shows how European competition law can balance the interests of
    well-functioning markets against supporting sustainability
    initiatives. Futureproof Competition Law will be essential reading
    for policy makers, legal professionals, responsible business
    conduct-managers, and civil society organizations. The lecture will
    also appeal to a broader audience, including students, interested in
    developments regarding how to shape institutions for a sustainable
    and open society. [Subject: Commercial Law, Competition Law,

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainability assessment is now emerging as a more transparent,
    comprehensive, integrated and far-sighted approach to decision
    making. Its basic demand is that all significant undertakings must
    make a positive contribution to sustainability. To apply this test,
    decision makers need criteria based on the core requirements of
    sustainability and the particularities of the context. As well, they
    need appropriately designed public processes; guidance on the
    weighing of alternatives, trade-offs and compromises; a supportive
    policy framework; suitable tools and inspiring examples. Drawing
    from transdisciplinary theory and practical case experience, the
    book addresses these matters and many of the surrounding
    controversies. While sustainability assessment must always be
    adjusted to particular circumstances, the generic approach set out
    in this book is applicable virtually anywhere.

    This book will bring a state of the art overview of the research
    done in sustainable logistics. It will be structured along the four
    A's of sustainable logistics:- 1 Awareness: it is important that
    companies and policy makers are aware of the effects of their
    activities and policies. New methods to estimate the effects of the
    logistic activities and the change towards more sustainable ways
    will be covered. 2 Avoidance: transport can be avoided by a better
    collaboration between actors (vertically and horizontally. Papers
    covering this topic will be introduced here. 3 Acting and shifting
    the goods to more environmental friendly modes or to the non peak
    hours. 4 Anticipation of new technologies: the use of more
    environmental friendly vehicles (electric,.LNG,..) within the
    logistic chain.

    'Conflict-Free' Socio-Economic Systems : Perspectives and Contradictions
*Authors:*
    Elena G. Popkova
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Bingley, UK : Emerald Publishing Limited. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    'Conflict-free'Socio-Economic Systems: Perspectives and
    Contradictions analyses crisis as a component of the growth and
    development process of economic systems, and its role within the
    economic cycle. The scientific treatment of the role of crisis in
    the development of economic systems has traditionally been divided
    into two conceptual approaches. The first conceptual approach views
    crisis as a possibility to reconsider the trajectory of economic
    development of both the national systems and the global economic
    system overall. However, most scholars, politicians, and experts
    focus on the second conceptual approach, within which economic
    crisis is seen as a temporary failure in the work of a system which
    hinders the process of economic growth and development. This became
    a precondition for proclaiming a new course of development of the
    modern national and global economic system oriented at
    sustainability. This book provides a strong theoretical and
    methodological basis to sustainable development of economic systems,
    for researchers and scholars in the area of economic theory and
    sustainable economics. In locating the role of crisis within
    socio-economic systems, Popkova advocates the concept of
    a'conflict-free'system as the landmark of global economic development.

*Description:*
    Since the first edition of this book was published, the subject of
    sustainability has risen to the forefront of thinking in almost
    every subject within business and management. Tackling the latest
    developments and integrating practical perspectives with rigorous
    research, this new edition sheds light on a vital aspect of working
    life. Current trends reveal that increasing intensity at work has
    major consequences at individual, organizational and societal
    levels. Sustainability in work systems thus requires a
    multi-stakeholder approach, emphasising a value-based choice to
    promote the concurrent development of various resources in the work
    system. This sustainability grows from intertwined individual and
    collective learning processes taking place within and between
    organizations in collaboration. In exploring the development of
    sustainable work systems, this book analyzes these problems, and
    provides the basis for designing and implementing'sustainable work
    systems'based on the idea of regeneration and the development of
    human and social resources. The authors, who are leading researchers
    and practitioners from around the world, consider the existing
    possibilities and emerging solutions and explore alternatives to
    intensive work systems.

*Publication Information:*
    [Place of publication not identified] : Yale University Press. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    An exploration of the lived experience of small-scale organic
    farmers in New England that unpacks how they balance their ideals
    with economic realities In recent years, the popularity of
    organically grown produce has exploded. In 2014, organic fruits and
    vegetables accounted for 12% of all produce sales in the United
    States, with $39 billion in consumer sales reported for 2015. As a
    federally recognized niche market within the agricultural
    mainstream, organic farming is increasingly on display in American
    grocery stores. Yet the organic food most Americans consume today is
    produced by an industrial food system at odds with the practices and
    ideals of small-scale farmers. Taking an ethnographic approach, the
    fieldwork by Connor Fitzmaurice and Brian Gareau at a small New
    England organic farm sheds light on how farmers navigate the
    difficult terrain between practices of sustainability and the
    economic realities of contemporary agriculture. Drawing on extensive
    research, Fitzmaurice and Gareau examine the historical context,
    complexities, and viability of nonconventional organic farming
    practices: practices that seek to balance ecology and community with
    the business of agriculture.

*Publication Information:*

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Experts consider green construction and the social, institutional,
    and cultural changes associated with it, through a sociological and
    organizational lens.Buildings are the nation's greatest energy
    consumers. Forty percent of all our energy is used for heating,
    cooling, lighting, and powering machines and devices in buildings.
    And despite decades of investment in green construction
    technologies, residential and commercial buildings remain stubbornly
    energy inefficient. This book looks beyond the technological and
    material aspects of green construction to examine the cultural,
    social, and organizational shifts that sustainable building
    requires, examining the fundamental challenge to centuries-long
    traditions in design and construction that green building
    represents.The contributors consider the changes associated with
    green building through a sociological and organizational lens. They
    discuss shifts in professional expertise created by new social
    concerns about green building, including evolving boundaries of
    professional jurisdictions; changing industry strategies and
    structures, including the roles of ownership, supply firms, and
    market niches; new operational, organizational, and cultural
    arrangements, including the mainstreaming of environmental concerns;
    narratives and frames that influence the perception of green
    building; and future directions for the theory and practice of
    sustainable construction. The essays offer uniquely
    multidisciplinary insights into the transformative potential of
    green building and the obstacles that must be overcome to make it
    the norm.ContributorsLauren Barhydt, Clayton Bartczak, Lyn Bartram,

*Description:*
    Sustainable Development, International Criminal Justice, and Treaty
    Implementation provides a serious and timely perspective on the
    relationship between two important and dynamic fields of
    international law. Comprising chapters written by leading academics
    and international lawyers, this book examines how the principles and
    practices of international criminal law and sustainable development
    can contribute to one another's elaboration, interpretation and
    implementation. Chapters in the book discuss the potential and
    limitations of international criminalization as a means for
    protecting the basic foundations of sustainable development; the
    role of existing international crimes in penalizing serious forms of
    economic, social, environmental and cultural harm; the indirect
    linkages that have developed between sustainable development and
    various mechanisms of criminal accountability and redress; and
    innovative proposals to broaden the scope of international criminal
    justice. With its rigorous and innovative arguments, this book forms
    a unique and urgent contribution to current debates on the future of
    global justice and sustainability.

    Strategic Sustainability : The State of the Art in Corporate
    Environmental Management Systems

*Publication Information:*

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The last decade has seen increasing awareness of the importance of
    understanding corporate environmental management systems (EMSs) and
    their relationships with sustainability, competitiveness and
    institutional practice. It is now assumed that most large companies
    have some version of an EMS in place with systems ranging from
    informal policies and practices to formalised third-party certified
    systems that are widely publicized by companies and are now integral
    to their strategic direction. No matter what level and type of
    system a firm chooses, both practitioners and researchers wish to
    examine and better understand the extent to which these systems are
    cross-functional, how they impact on performance evaluation, their
    capability to monitor supply chains and the life-cycles of products
    and services and, most importantly, whether these systems actually
    make a contribution to better environmental performance. This book
    provides intriguing insights into strategic and sustainable EMSs. It
    provides clear evidence of benefits that should exceed the costs
    (tangible and otherwise), and help practitioners understand the
    attributes of well-developed and strategically focused EMSs. It also
    demonstrates the link to performance measures such as reputation,
    improved position in the marketplace, cost, quality, waste reduction
    and numerous sustainable development-based metrics and issues. The
    comprehensive scope of topics spans several industries and provides
    environmental systems insight involving sustainable management
    systems, strategic and operational impacts of environmental systems,
    cross-country comparisons of EMS design processes and results,
    product-based environmental systems, EMS impacts at innovative
    organisations and environmental systems integration within specific
    industries. The book is split into three sections. First, the book
    covers the broad issues of planning and designing an EMS and
    includes topics such as performance evaluation, comparisons between
    multinational environmental systems, sustainable development and
    links between already established quality systems and an EMS. The
    second section focuses on EMS implementation and operation and
    incorporates some corporate or industry-specific case studies. The
    third and final category of the book highlights the use of an EMS to
    evaluate business processes. Strategic Sustainability will be
    essential reading for both managers faced with decisions regarding
    their own EMSs and to researchers seeking additional insights from
    state-of-the-art examples for further theoretical development and
    testing.

    Teaching Business Sustainability : From Theory to Practice
*Series:*
    Teaching Business Sustainability, v. 1
*Authors:*
    Chris Galea
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England : Routledge. 2004
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In a world where corporate governance scandals have become the
    everyday, the role of business schools in producing the managers of
    today – and tomorrow – has come into sharp focus. Today's managers
    and the MBAs that will follow them are in need of an education that
    grounds business ethics and the overarching concerns of sustainable
    development into the curriculum. As some, but by no means all,
    organisations are coming to realise, bad performance in
    environmental protection, labour practices and human rights is no
    longer a'soft'issue but one that can hit the bottom line with a
    vengeance. So, what is the state of the art in teaching business
    sustainability worldwide, and what teaching practices and tools are
    achieving successful results? This book begins to answer these
    questions and more.There are many challenges facing educators in the
    field of sustainability. It is an evolving field still in its
    infancy as a management discipline; and there is also the need to
    combat the unstated but often underlying assumption that many
    environmental and social issues represent non-valued-added effort.
    Teaching Business Sustainability acknowledges this problem, while
    helping students explore the various ways in which the theoretical
    value of business sustainability can result in valuable and
    value-added practical outcomes.A wide mix of approaches is therefore
    indicated; while many of these are experimental and on the leading
    edge of management learning, they all share an experiential (and
    often a team-based) element, and attempt to bring together the
    theory in a way that makes it relevant to practitioners in the
    field. The implication is that, whenever possible, educators need to
    link the learning to the students'immediate and
    pressing'real-world'realities. This applies equally to
    undergraduates or high-level executives. However, in the absence of
    immediate examples of such realities (as may often be the case in
    undergraduate settings) educators need to introduce experientially
    based approaches that recreate such settings in the classroom.The
    book also argues the case for holistic and interdisciplinary
    learning. It is clear from much of the literature on sustainability
    that the concept does not easily lend itself to being pigeonholed
    and that it crosses many of the functional areas of business.
    Indeed, it goes beyond just business learning to encompass many
    fields such as ecology, engineering and biology. If students are to
    move beyond the narrow perspective that conventional business
    studies often entail, they need to be introduced to the wider vision
    that an interdisciplinary approach engenders.The final point that
    emerges from this collection is that experiential learning of
    business sustainability often can, and should be, fun! Be it a
    heated exchange in a case-study discussion, a role-play exercise or
    a hands-on student consulting project, much experiential learning
    seems to excite the imagination of the students and to release their
    creative juices.The 23 contributions to Teaching Business
    Sustainability have been divided into three thematic groups. In the
    first section,'Theory, Critique and Ideas', the authors explore and
    critique some of the overarching ideas and thinking behind the
    teaching of sustainability. The next section,'Learning from Current
    Practice', contains the experiences of a number of educators and the
    successful and leading-edge approaches that they have used. The
    final section then outlines tools, methods and approaches that can
    be used to teach business sustainability. This last section also
    serves as an introduction to a second volume – Teaching Business
    Sustainability Vol. 2 – which provides educators of sustainability
    with a series of case studies, role plays and experiential
    exercises. Teaching Business Sustainability is an invaluable
    resource both for educators working in a wide range of academic
    disciplines, looking for inspiration and guidance on how to teach
    business sustainability, as well as f

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This compelling account charts the relentless trajectory of
    humankind, and its changing survival and disease patterns, across
    place and time from when our ancient ancestors roamed the African
    Savannah to today's populous, industrialised, globalising world.
    This expansion of human frontiers - geographic, climatic, cultural
    and technological - has encountered frequent setbacks from disease,
    famine and dwindling resources. The social and environmental
    transformations wrought by agrarianism, industrialisation, fertility
    control, social modernisation, urbanisation and mass consumption
    have profoundly affected patterns of health and disease. Today, as
    life expectancies rise, the planet's ecosystems are being damaged by
    the combined weight of population size and intensive economic
    activity. Global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion and loss of
    biodiversity pose large-scale hazards to human health and survival.
    Recognising this, can we achieve a transition to sustainability?
    This and other profound questions underlie this chronicle of
    expansive human activity, social change, environmental impact and
    their health consequences.

*Resource Type:*

*Description:*
    Comforting terms such as'sustainable development'and'green
    production'frame environmental debate by stressing technology (not
    green enough), economic growth (not enough in the right places), and
    population (too large). Concern about consumption emerges, if at
    all, in benign ways; as calls for green purchasing or more
    recycling, or for small changes in production processes. Many
    academics, policymakers, and journalists, in fact, accept the
    economists'view of consumption as nothing less than the purpose of
    the economy. Yet many people have a troubled, intuitive
    understanding that tinkering at the margins of production and
    purchasing will not put society on an ecologically and socially
    sustainable path. Confronting Consumption places consumption at the
    center of debate by conceptualizing'the consumption problem'and
    documenting diverse efforts to confront it. In Part 1, the book
    frames consumption as a problem of political and ecological economy,
    emphasizing core concepts of individualization and commoditization.
    Part 2 develops the idea of distancing and examines transnational
    chains of consumption in the context of economic globalization. Part
    3 describes citizen action through local currencies, home power,
    voluntary simplicity,'ad-busting,'and product certification.
    Together, the chapters propose'cautious consuming'and'better
    producing'as an activist and policy response to environmental
    problems. The book concludes that confronting consumption must
    become a driving focus of contemporary environmental scholarship and
    activism.

    Essays follow rapidly proliferating and resource-intensive Indian
    urbanism in everyday environments. Case studies on nature
    conservation in cities, urban housing and slum development, waste
    management, urban planning, and contestations over the quality of
    air, water, and sanitation in Delhi and Mumbai illuminate urban
    ecology per­spectives throughout the twentieth century. The

*Description:*
    The philosophy of information is one of the most exciting and
    fruitful areas of current philosophical research. Not only is it
    affecting the way in which new and old philosophical problems are
    addressed, but it is also creating a substantial innovation of the
    philosophical system. This book contains selected papers presented
    at the 2011 spring conference entitled ‘Philosophy and Synergy of
    Information: Sustainability and Security', held in Tbilisi, and
    supported by the NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme. The
    conference welcomed scientists from different disciplines and
    different countries, both eastern and western. They met to share
    their ideas, the results of their research and their experiences
    related to information science and technology, philosophy, the
    nature and culture of information and the problems of sustainable
    development for countries, regions and continents. Subjects covered
    include the latest innovations in informatics, forecasting, quantum
    information theory, nano information-communication systems and many
    more. Since ancient times, philosophers have been preoccupied with
    investigating life and security in the cosmos (world order). This
    book will be of interest to all those involved in that endeavor.

*Title:*
    Landscape Urbanism and Its Discontents : Dissimulating the
    Sustainable City
*Authors:*
    Duany, Andres
*Publication Information:*
    Gabriola, BC : New Society Publishers. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Landscape Urbanism and New Urbanism - negotiating the relationship
    between cities and the natural world In contemporary Western
    society, urban development is regarded as an unfortunate blight from
    which nature provides a much-needed respite. This apparent dichotomy
    ignores the interdependence between human settlement and the natural
    world. In fact, one of the most pressing problems facing urban
    theorists today is determining how to resolve the tension between
    the built and natural environments, in the process creating truly
    sustainable cities. Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents is a
    collection of essays exploring the debate over urban reform, now
    polarized around the two competing paradigms of Landscape Urbanism
    and the New Urbanism. Landscape Urbanism is conceived as a more
    ecologically based approach, while New Urbanism is more concerned
    with the built form. Well-known and influential urban theorists such
    as Andrés Duany and James Howard Kunstler delve into the impact of
    the tension between the two perspectives on: Smart growth
    Neighborhood design Sustainable development Creating cities that are
    in balance with nature While there is significant overlap between
    Landscape Urbanism and the New Urbanism, the former has assumed
    prominence amongst most critical theorists, whereas the latter's
    proponents are more practically oriented. Given that these two sets
    of ideas are at the forefront of sustainable urban design, the
    analysis– and potential reconciliation—offered by Landscape Urbanism
    and its Discontents is long overdue. Andrés Duany is a leading
    proponent of the New Urbanism and is a founding principal at Duany
    Plater-Zyberk & Company. Emily Talen is a professor at Arizona State
    University and the author of four previous books on urban design.

    Do We Know What We Are Doing? Reflections on Learning, Knowledge,

*Authors:*
    Jucker, Rolf
*Publication Information:*
    Newcastle upon Tyne : Cambridge Scholars Publishing. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The discourse of education for sustainability has been severely
    limited by the fact that it largely refuses to acknowledge important
    insights from other fields of learning and knowledge. This
    reluctance to engage with central insights regarding how the world
    and, more specifically, how human interactions with both the human
    and non-human world work, ensures that it has remained a largely
    self-centred discourse. It is tangled up with reflections on
    education without contextualising them in the real world. As such,
    it is not just education in general, but also so-called “education
    for sustainable development” (ESD), that needs to perform a radical
    paradigm shift and become communal learning in real-time in a real
    place. This, therefore, necessitates a willingness to face some
    tough questions regarding its prevailing insularity.

    A Pivotal Moment : Population, Justice, and the Environmental Challenge
*Authors:*
    Laurie Ann Mazur
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C. : Island Press. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Through a series of essays by leading demographers,
    environmentalists and reproductive health advocates, A Pivotal
    Moment offers a new perspective on the complex connection between
    population dynamics and environmental quality. It presents the
    latest research on the relationship between population growth and
    climate change, ecosystem health and other environmental issues. It
    surveys the new demographic landscape—in which population growth
    rates have fallen, but human numbers continue to increase. It looks
    back at the lessons learned from half a century of population
    policy—and forward to propose twenty-first century population
    policies that are sustainable and just. A Pivotal Moment puts forth
    the concept of “population justice,” which is inspired by
    reproductive justice and environmental justice movements. Population
    justice holds that inequality is a root cause of both rapid
    population growth and environmental degradation. As the authors in
    this volume explain, to slow population growth and build a
    sustainable future, women and men need access to voluntary family
    planning and other reproductive health services. They need education
    and employment opportunities, especially for women. Population
    justice means tackling the deep inequities—both gender and
    economic—that are associated with rapid population growth and
    unsustainable resource consumption. Where family planning is
    available, where couples are confident their children will survive,
    where girls go to school, where young men and women have economic
    opportunity—there couples will have healthier and smaller families.

*Title:*
    Urban Street Stormwater Guide
*Authors:*
    National Association of City Transportation Officials
*Publication Information:*
    San Francisco : Island Press. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Streets make up more than 80 percent of all public space in cities,
    yet street space is often underutilized or disproportionately
    allocated to the movement of private motor vehicles. Excess
    impervious surface contributes to stormwater runoff, posing a threat
    to the environment and human health, and often overwhelming sewer
    systems. This excess asphalt also poses a threat to public safety,
    encouraging faster speeds and dangerous conditions for people
    walking and biking. The Urban Street Stormwater Guide begins from
    the principle that street design can support—or degrade—the urban
    area's overall environmental health. By incorporating Green
    Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) into the right-of-way, cities can
    manage stormwater and reap the public health, environmental, and
    aesthetic benefits of street trees, planters, and greenery in the
    public realm. With thoughtful design, GSI can bolster strategies to
    provide a safe and pleasant walking and biking experience, efficient
    and reliable transit service, and safer streets for all users.
    Building on the successful NACTO urban street guides, the Urban
    Street Stormwater Guide provides the best practices for the design
    of GSI along transportation corridors. The authors consider
    context-sensitive design elements related to street design,
    character and use, zoning, posted speed, traffic volumes, and
    impacts to non-motorized and vehicular access. The Guide documents
    and synthesizes current practices being developed by individual
    agencies and recommends design guidance for implementation, as well
    as explores innovative new strategies being tested in cities
    nationwide. The guidance will focus on providing safe, functioning
    and maintainable infrastructure that meets the unique needs and
    requirements of the transportation corridors and its various uses
    and users. The state-of-the-art solutions in this guide will assist
    urban planners and designers, transportation engineers, city
    officials, ecologists, public works officials, and others interested
    in the role of the built urban landscape in protecting the climate,
    water quality, and natural environment.

*Description:*
    The days of rapid economic growth in China are over. Mounting debt
    and rising internal distortions mean that rebalancing is inevitable.
    Beijing has no choice but to take significant steps to restructure
    its economy. The only question is how to proceed.Michael Pettis
    debunks the lingering bullish expectations for China's economic rise
    and details Beijing's options. The urgent task of shifting toward
    greater domestic consumption will come with political costs, but
    Beijing must increase household income and reduce its reliance on
    investment to avoid a fall.

    Sustainable Development, Decent Work and Green Jobs : Fifth Item on
    the Agenda
*Series:*
    Report, 102nd session, Report V
*Publication Information:*
    Geneva : International Labour Office. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This report addresses two of the defining challenges of the
    twenty-first century: achieving environmental sustainability and
    turning the vision of decent work for all into a reality. It shows
    that not only are both challenges urgent, but they are also
    intimately linked and will have to be addressed together. Chapter 1
    analyses the environmental and social challenges facing the world
    against the backdrop of the current economic crisis. It explores the
    relationship between them and introduces concepts which help to
    evaluate social and labour market impacts. Chapter 2 identifies
    three major opportunities to advance decent work in a greener
    economy in the form of more jobs, better jobs and social inclusion.
    Chapter 3 explores three challenges linked to a transition to a
    greener economy from a world of work perspective, notably
    restructuring, employment losses and relocation of workers; the
    pressing need to adapt to climate change; and inadvertent negative
    impacts on income distribution. Chapter 4 outlines relevant policy
    initiatives at national and international levels, gives an overview
    of current ILO work in this area, summarizes policy lessons from
    national experiences and research, and explores the implications for
    the agendas of ILO constituents and the Office.

*Authors:*

*Publication Information:*
    New York : Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    An international team of leading scholars and young researchers in
    environmental psychology offers a relatively new perspective on the
    origin and solutions of the current environmental crisis. They
    explain how human nature has played a prominent role in the
    emergence of ecological problems such as global warming, threats to
    biodiversity, resources scarcity and pollution. But also, they
    demonstrate that such problems are interlinked with social problems
    such as poverty, famine, social and economical inequities and
    violence. According to this book's authors, psychological theories
    and empirical evidence show that the solutions for those
    socio-ecological problems are to be found in human nature and its
    psychological predispositions. These include personal motives,
    world-visions, future perspective, environmental emotions,
    altruistic tendencies and behavioral capacities among other
    psychological predispositions that could allow the adoption of
    sustainable lifestyles. Meeting the ideals of sustainability
    requires the participation of the natural and social sciences,
    including psychology, in order to guarantee the fulfillment of its
    purposes. Behavioral sciences study the psychological
    characteristics and the contextual factors that lead people to adopt
    more sustainable lifestyles. In addition, these sciences investigate
    how sustainable behaviors promote happiness, psychological well
    being and restoration, which are considered among the aims of
    sustainable development by governments throughout the world. The
    authors, who are recognized experts in these areas, offer a
    state-of-the-art review and data on what it is known regarding the
    psychological dimensions of the environmental crisis, its behavioral
    solutions and the repercussions of sustainable behavior on human
    well being.

    Vital Signs 2012 : The Trends That Are Shaping Our Future
*Series:*
    Vital Signs Series
*Authors:*
    The The Worldwatch Institute
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C. : Island Press. 2012
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Just as people schedule regular check-ups with physicians, our
    planet needs regular check-ups to catch issues as early as possible,
    before they become more serious and harder to heal. That is the
    much-needed service provided on a global scale by the Worldwatch
    Institute in this new book, Vital Signs 2012. By taking stock of
    global consumption, Vital Signs 2012 offers the facts that need to
    guide our stewardship of the Earth's resources-and some of these
    facts are shocking. The report covers topics from obesity to
    ecosystem services, from grain production to nuclear power. Taken as
    a whole, it paints a picture of skyrocketing population,
    disappearing forests, and increasing consumption peppered with
    bright spots like growing investment in high-speed trains and other
    efficient transportation systems. Vital Signs 2012 is based on
    Worldwatch's online project of the same name, which provides
    up-to-date figures on important global concerns, as well as the
    Institute's own additional research. The book compiles the most
    important of these into an accessible, informative resource for
    policymakers and anyone who wants a realistic look at the state of
    our planet.

*Publication Information:*

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    'Measuring the sustainability of development is crucial to achieving
    it, and is one of the most actively studied issues in the area. To
    date, most studies of measurements or indicators have been largely
    theoretical. However, this book, a follow-on to Bell and Morse's
    highly influential Sustainability Indicators (1999), presents
    valuable practical advice on how to develop measurements that will
    work in real-life development contexts. It describes and analyses
    how to derive, validate and apply indicators in the course of an
    actual development project - in this case the Mediterranean Action
    Plan in Malta. The authors explain the trade-offs and constraints
    involved and how it is possible to combine the open-ended and
    flexible perspectives of sustainability with the more linear
    processes and fixed targets of specific projects through the use of
    pragmatic and reflective methodologies.

*Description:*
    In this volume, rhetoricians, literacy scholars, and humanists have

    place and space; community literacy; historical and archival
    analysis of institutional politics, policies, and practices
    concerning the environment and economic growth and development; town
    planning and zoning issues; and rhetorics of environmental
    remediation and sustainability, this collection of essays provides
    rhetoricians and environmentalists a window into the complex and

    Understanding Planned Obsolescence : Unsustainability Through
    Production, Consumption and Waste Generation
*Authors:*
    Pope, Kamila
*Publication Information:*
    London : Kogan Page. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Planned obsolescence is a strategy used to make products obsolete,
    leading to their premature replacement. The result is the
    over-exploitation of natural resources, increased waste and
    detrimental social impacts. It is a known practice in consumer
    electronics and affects other industries as they put profit before
    consequence.A ground-breaking new book, Understanding Planned
    Obsolescence looks at the causes, cost and impact of planned
    obsolescence. It considers the legal and economic frameworks to
    overcome the practice and how to mitigate its effects. It also
    unearths new patterns of production and consumption highlighting
    more sustainable development models. Including a wide range of case
    studies from Europe, USA and South America, Understanding Planned
    Obsolescence is a vital step forward for the future of business and
    academia alike. Online resources now available include
    chapter-by-chapter lecturer slides.

*Authors:*
    Benoît Martimort-Asso
*Publication Information:*
    Aldershot, England : Routledge. 2007
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Presenting extensive new research, this ground-breaking study
    addresses the critical dimensions of participatory and democratic
    processes in the field of trade-sustainability relationships and
    sustainability assessments of trade rules. The specific issues in
    trade include social and environmental concerns for which there is a
    wide disparity of preferences and no economic benchmark. The
    contributors provide analytical responses to questions of how
    deliberative processes can adequately close the democratic gap in
    global governance and how institutional reforms can ensure better
    access to information, transparency, deliberation and more
    accountability. The book provides the necessary theoretical
    background as well as case studies to understand these issues and is
    suitable for students and academics in international law,
    international relations and economics.

*Authors:*
    Raymond W Y Kao
*Publication Information:*
    Singapore : World Scientific. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book explains how corporate social responsibility is linked to
    long-term sustainability of an economy and that the activities of an
    organization should not be only for its self-interest, but must also
    be honed for the benefit of common good. A major approach the book
    advocates is corporate decision-makers in an organization should
    work towards earning the trust of stakeholders rather than focus on
    short-term profitability. It also emphasizes the importance of
    recognizing and rewarding the contribution and commitment by
    participants of an organization.Written by academics and
    consultants, this book will be of interest to academicians, media
    professionals, organizational participants, entrepreneurs and
    general public.

*Description:*
    Upon George Mitchell's death in 2013, The Economist proclaimed, “Few
    businesspeople have done as much to change the world as George
    Mitchell,” a billionaire Texas oilman who defied the stereotypical
    swagger so identified with that industry. In George P. Mitchell:
    Fracking, Sustainability, and an Unorthodox Quest to Save the
    Planet, award-winning author Loren C. Steffy offers the first
    definitive biography of Mitchell, placing his life and legacy in a
    global context, from the significance of his discoveries to the
    lingering controversies they inspired. Mitchell will forever be
    known as “the father of fracking,” but he didn't invent the drilling
    process; he perfected it and made it profitable, one of many varied
    ventures he pursued for years. Long before his company ever fracked
    a well, he pioneered sustainable development by creating The
    Woodlands, near Houston, one of the first and most successful
    master-planned communities. Its focus on environmental protection
    and livability redefined the American suburb. This apparent
    contradiction between his energy interests and environmental
    pursuits, which his son Todd dubbed “the Mitchell Paradox,” was just
    one of many that defined Mitchell's life. Anyone who puts fuel in a
    tank or turns on a light switch has benefited from Mitchell's
    efforts. This compelling biography reveals Mitchell as a modern
    renaissance man who sought to make the world a better, more livable
    place, a man whose unbounded intellectual curiosity led him to
    support a wide range of interests in business, science, and
    philanthropy.

    Global Sustainability : Bending the Curve

    Routledge/SEI Global Environment and Development Series, Vol. 3
*Authors:*
    Gilberto C. Gallopín
    Paul D. Raskin
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2002
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Unprecedented levels of wealth, technology and institutional
    capacity can forge a just, peaceful and ecologically resilient
    future. However, the authors argue, social polarization,
    geo-political conflict and environmental degradation are threatening
    the long-term well-being of humanity and the planet. Global
    Sustainability explores the alternative futures that could emerge
    from the resolution of these antagonisms. Based on extensive
    international and interdisciplinary research, the book identifies
    the perils of market-driven scenarios and considers the possibility
    of the failure of conventional approaches. It also, however,
    presents a vision of the possibility of a'Great Transition'in which
    revised human values and development goals bring a new stage of
    civilization. It will be essential reading for all scholars and
    professionals interested in the future of the environment,
    international affairs, and sustainable development.

    Managing the Business Case for Sustainability : The Integration of
    Social, Environmental and Economic Performance
*Authors:*
    Stefan Schaltegger
    Marcus Wagner
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 2006
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The difficulties in moving towards corporate sustainability raise
    the question of how environmental and social management can be
    integrated better with economic business goals. Over the last
    decade, the relationship between environmental and economic
    performance, and more recently the interaction between
    sustainability performance and business competitiveness, have
    received considerable attention in both theory and practice.
    However, to date, only partial aspects of the relationship between
    sustainability performance, competitiveness and economic performance
    have been studied from a theoretical as well as an empirical
    perspective. And, to date, no unique relationship has prevailed in
    empirical studies. A number of explanations have been put forward to
    explain this, including methodological reasons, such as the lack of
    statistical data, the low quality of that data, or the fact that
    such data is often available for short time periods only. Other
    theoretical explanations have been developed, such as the influence
    of different corporate strategies or the relatively small influence
    of environmental or sustainability issues as one factor among many
    on the economic or financial success of firms. So, how should the
    business case for sustainability be managed? This is the starting
    point for this book, which compiles insights on a large number of
    aspects of the link between sustainability performance, business
    competitiveness and economic success in an attempt to provide a
    comprehensive and structured view of this relationship. The book
    provides an unrivalled body of knowledge on the state of theory and
    practice in this field and identifies prospective future fields of
    work. The book includes: conceptual frameworks for the interaction
    of social, environmental and economic issues in business
    environments; case studies of companies that have successfully
    integrated social, environmental and economic issues; analyses of
    the causal and empirical relationship between environmental and/or
    social performance, business performance and firm-level
    competitiveness; concepts and tools useful for improving business
    value with proactive operational strategies; assessment of the
    factors influencing operational sustainability strategies and their
    economic impact; and comparisons of interactions between
    sustainability performance and firm competitiveness across industry
    sectors and countries. Managing the Business Case for Sustainability
    is the definitive work in its field: the most comprehensive book yet
    published on the theory and practice of managing sustainability
    performance, competitiveness, environmental, social and economic
    performance in an integrated way. It will be essential reading for
    managers, academics, consultants, fund managers, governments and
    government agencies, NGOs and international bodies who need a broad
    and comprehensive overview of the business case for sustainability.

    Prairie Crossing : Creating an American Conservation Community
*Authors:*
    John Scott Watson
*Publication Information:*
    Urbana : University of Illinois Press. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Carved out of century-old farmland near Chicago, the Prairie
    Crossing development is a novel experiment in urban public policy
    that preserves 69 percent of the land as open space. The for-profit
    project has set out to do nothing less than use access to nature as
    a means to challenge America's failed culture of suburban sprawl.
    The first comprehensive look at an American conservation community,
    Prairie Crossing goes beyond windmills and nest boxes to examine an
    effort to connect adults to the land while creating a healthy and
    humane setting for raising a new generation attuned to nature. John
    Scott Watson places Prairie Crossing within the wider context of
    suburban planning, revealing how two first-time developers
    implemented a visionary new land ethic that saved green space by
    building on it. The remarkable achievements include a high rate of
    resident civic participation, the reestablishment of a thriving
    prairie ecosystem, the reintroduction of endangered and threatened
    species, and improved water and air quality. Yet, as Watson shows,
    considerations like economic uncertainty, lack of racial and class
    diversity, and politics have challenged, and continue to challenge,
    Prairie Crossing and its residents.

    The Making of a Democratic Economy : Building Prosperity For the
    Many, Not Just the Few
*Authors:*
    Marjorie Kelly
    Ted Howard
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Oakland, CA : Berrett-Koehler Publishers. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Our economy is designed by the 1 percent, for the 1 percent. This
    book offers a compelling vision of an equitable, ecologically
    sustainable alternative that meets the essential needs of all
    people.We live in a world where twenty-six billionaires own as much
    wealth as half the planet's population. The extractive economy we
    live with now enables the financial elite to squeeze out maximum
    gain for themselves, heedless of damage to people or planet. But
    Marjorie Kelly and Ted Howard show that there is a new economy
    emerging focused on helping everyone thrive while respecting
    planetary boundaries. At a time when competing political visions are
    at stake the world over, this book urges a move beyond tinkering at
    the margins to address the systemic crisis of our economy. Kelly and
    Howard outline seven principles of what they call a Democratic
    Economy: community, inclusion, place (keeping wealth local), good
    work (putting labor before capital), democratized ownership, ethical
    finance, and sustainability. Each principle is paired with a place
    putting it into practice: Pine Ridge, Preston, Portland, Cleveland,
    and more.This book tells stories not just of activists and
    grassroots leaders but of the unexpected accomplices of the
    Democratic Economy. Seeds of a future beyond corporate capitalism
    and state socialism are being planted in hospital procurement
    departments, pension fund offices, and even company boardrooms. The
    road to a system grounded in community, democracy, and justice
    remains uncertain. Kelly and Howard help us understand we make this
    road as we walk it by taking a first step together beyond isolation
    and despair.

*Publication Information:*

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Grounded in current issues and constraints, this book focuses on
    valuing environmental degradation, green economic growth,
    trade–environment linkage, climate change, health outcome efficiency
    and public works programmes. Can the ‘impressive'growth rates
    registered by the Indian economy last in the long run? If so, are
    they inclusive of the key dimensions of well-being? Can the balance
    between India's demand for and supply of natural capital make the
    country an ecological debtor? This volume, in honour of Professor U.
    Sankar, addresses such significant debates and provides policy
    initiatives to tackle these issues. This book argues that
    sustainable development as a long-term objective demands a paradigm
    shift in the approach to viewing ecology and that sustainability has
    to be assessed in terms of economic, social and environmental outcomes.

    Climate Change and the Future of Water
*Authors:*
    ECSSR
*Publication Information:*
    [S.l.] : The Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Across the Middle East, population growth and the rising consumption
    of water represent two key variables that are closely intertwined.
    When added to the projected impact of climate change on the region,
    they threaten to undermine established methods that attempt to
    ensure a manageable level of domestic and regional water security.
    Developing nations lacking water security are forced to contend with
    the looming complications this shortage could yield, which
    consequently obstruct attempts to achieve long-term, sustainable
    development. It is therefore imperative that policy and
    decision-makers be mindful of ongoing environmental, societal and
    technological developments that hold the potential to either better
    assist, or alternatively, hinder their efforts in managing limited
    water supplies. The conference, titled ‘Climate Change and the
    Future of Water', co-organized by the ECSSR and the University of
    Maine, was held in Abu Dhabi from October 14–15, 2014. It brought
    together a group of distinguished experts and scientific researchers
    drawn from academia and government to provide valuable insights into
    developments in climate change and water security. In view of the
    clear importance of this issue to the Arab Gulf region, the ECSSR is
    pleased to present the resultant papers compiled in this volume.
    These professional and academic perspectives regarding regional
    implications of climate change and water scarcity offer innovative
    approaches to combatting some of the problems tied to climate change
    and water security.

*Title:*
    The Story of N : A Social History of the Nitrogen Cycle and the
    Challenge of Sustainability
*Series:*
    Studies in Modern Science, Technology, and the Environment
*Authors:*
    Gorman, Hugh S.
*Publication Information:*
    New Brunswick, N.J. : Rutgers University Press. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In The Story of N, Hugh S. Gorman analyzes the notion of
    sustainability from a fresh perspective—the integration of human
    activities with the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen—and provides
    a supportive alternative to studying sustainability through the lens
    of climate change and the cycling of carbon. It is the first book to
    examine the social processes by which industrial societies learned
    to bypass a fundamental ecological limit and, later, began
    addressing the resulting concerns by establishing limits of their
    own The book is organized into three parts. Part I, “The Knowledge
    of Nature,” explores the emergence of the nitrogen cycle before
    humans arrived on the scene and the changes that occurred as
    stationary agricultural societies took root. Part II, “Learning to
    Bypass an Ecological Limit,” examines the role of science and market
    capitalism in accelerating the pace of innovation, eventually
    allowing humans to bypass the activity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
    Part III, “Learning to Establish Human-Defined Limits,” covers the
    twentieth-century response to the nitrogen-related concerns that
    emerged as more nitrogenous compounds flowed into the environment. A
    concluding chapter, “The Challenge of Sustainability,” places the
    entire story in the context of constructing an ecological economy in
    which innovations that contribute to sustainable practices are rewarded.

*Publication Information:*
    New Haven : Yale University Press. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In this book Nicholas A. Ashford and Ralph P. Hall offer a unified,
    transdisciplinary approach for achieving sustainable development in
    industrialized nations. They present an insightful analysis of the
    ways in which industrial states are currently unsustainable and how
    economic and social welfare are related to the environment, to
    public health and safety, and to earning capacity and meaningful and
    rewarding employment. The authors argue for the design of
    multipurpose solutions to the sustainability challenge that
    integrate economics, employment, technology, environment, industrial
    development, national and international law, trade, finance, and
    public and worker health and safety. This book is essential reading
    for anyone with a policy or scholarly interest in sustainable
    development and the critical roles of the economy, employment, and
    the environment.

    Scale, Governance and Change in Zambezi Teak Forests : Sustainable
    Development for Commodity and Community
*Authors:*
    Musgrave, Michael
*Publication Information:*
    Newcastle upon Tyne : Cambridge Scholars Publishing. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The Zambezi Teak forests of western Zambia have been exploited for
    their timber for over 80 years. The record of this exploitation and
    the subsequent collapse of the timber industry provide a unique
    insight into problems around land use change, governance and the
    interaction between ecology, society and forest management in
    south-central Africa. A wide-ranging study, this book is as much an
    examination of methodology for sustainability research as it is a
    review of land use change, forest management and rural livelihoods.
    It explores the problem of scale and how using explicit
    considerations of scale may contribute to an integration between the
    life sciences and the social sciences that a holistic assessment of
    sustainable development problems demands. Specific details of land
    use change in the region are examined over a 30 year period,
    including the first detailed mapping of changes to the Zambezi Teak
    forests since logging ceased in the early 1970s. Forest management
    practices and fire emerge as important drivers of land use change,
    and the book provides examples of how forest management and
    governance are important to sustainable development in this sparsely
    populated and inaccessible region.For readers interested a detailed
    understanding of the problems of deforestation, land use change and
    governance in the dry forests of Africa, this book is essential
    reading. It also provides insights into wider questions of how
    multidisciplinary studies may be integrated in a holistic
    synthesis.African dry forests have been widely studied, but few
    publications examine the problems of land use change and
    deforestation in this level of detail. The author draws on 20 years
    of experience in south-central Africa to combine historical records
    with research on current political, social and governance issues.
    The result is a landmark publication which covers a depth and
    breadth that is seldom achieved in studies of African sustainable
    development.

    Sustainability : Life Chances and Livelihoods
*Authors:*
    Michael Redclift
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2000
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The concept of sustainability is traditionally viewed in exclusively
    environmental terms. Sustainability: Life Chances and Livelihoods
    links peoples livelihoods and life chances to the concept of
    sustainability by examining the way in which social and economic
    processes complement and compound environmental change. Looking at
    the main ingredients of sustainable development - health, economic
    policy, land use, ethics and education, in both the north and south,
    this book demonstrates the way in which the life chances of
    individuals both effect and are affected by, their
    environments.Sustainability: Life Chances and Livelihoods shows that
    the scope of sustainability thinking needs to be widened to embrace
    public policies and experiences in both developed and developing
    countries.By providing a comparative focus, both spatially and
    temporally, the contributors demonstrate how the environmental
    concerns of the northern developed world are culturally translated
    into the south, often into immediate survival questions.

    Daniela Velte
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2003
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainable development will not be possible without fundamental
    improvements in resource productivity and energy efficiency, the
    adaptation of material flows into natural cycles as well as a
    radical change in production and consumption patterns. In essence,
    what is required is not only an ecological approach to product
    design but also new marketing and consumption patterns for products
    that can satisfy our needs in a more environmentally sound way.In
    recent years there has been growing interest in the possibilities of
    eco-services to achieve some of these aims. Ecologically oriented
    leasing, renting, pooling and sharing, where the emphasis is placed
    on the sale of a product's use rather than on the product itself,
    offer great possibilities for innovation and environmental impact
    reduction. At the same time, there are opportunities to create new
    commercial enterprises, produce added value to production and
    distribution functions, and therefore create jobs. Up until now,
    however, there has been little research about the state of the art
    in eco-services, how new services can be developed, what the
    attitudes of consumers are to services rather than products and what
    the consequences of such a structural adjustment would be for firms.
    Eco-service Development addresses this lack of research, first by
    providing a comprehensive inventory and analysis of current
    eco-services in four European countries: Germany, Austria, the
    Netherlands and Spain. It then systematically explores the options
    open to market participants, the potential for environmental impact
    reduction, potential barriers to eco-services (such as consumer and
    producer resistance) and, finally, with what political and legal
    instruments ecologically oriented services can best be promoted. The
    book analyzes eight consumer sectors – washing, cleaning, cooking,
    entertainment, gardening, do-it-yourself, mobility and leisure time
    – from the point of view of both supply and demand and highlights
    the optimization potential and development perspectives for
    commercial new use eco-service concepts. This book is the most
    comprehensive analysis yet published of how eco-services are being
    implemented and how they could best be encouraged and contains
    valuable lessons for policy-makers, interested businesses and all
    those in the academic community searching for ways to dematerialize
    the economy.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Natural environments provide enormously valuable, but largely
    unappreciated, services that aid humans and other earthlings. It is
    becoming clear that these life-support systems are faltering and
    failing worldwide due to human actions that disrupt nature's ability
    to do its beneficial work. Ecosystem Services: Charting a Path to
    Sustainability documents the National Academies'Keck Futures
    Initiative Conference on Ecosystem Services. At this conference,
    participants were divided into 14 interdisciplinary research teams
    to explore diverse challenges at the interface of science,
    engineering, and medicine. The teams needed to address the challenge
    of communicating and working together from a diversity of expertise
    and perspectives as they attempted to solve a complicated,
    interdisciplinary problem in a relatively short time. Ecosystem
    Services: Charting a Path to Sustainability describes how ecosystem
    services scientists work to document the direct and indirect links
    between humanity's well-being and the many benefits provided by the
    natural systems we occupy. This report explains the specific topics
    the interdisciplinary research teams addressed at the conference,
    including the following: -how ecosystem services affect infectious
    and chronic diseases -how to identify what resources can be produced
    renewably or recovered by developing intense technologies that can
    be applied on a massive scale -how to develop social and technical
    capabilities to respond to abrupt changes in ecosystem services -how
    to design agricultural and aquacultural systems that provide food
    security while maintaining the full set of ecosystem services needed
    from landscapes and seascapes -how to design production systems for
    ecosystem services that improve human outcomes related to food and
    nutrition -how to develop appropriate methods to accurately value
    natural capital and ecosystem services -how to design a federal
    policy to maintain or improve natural capital and ecosystem services
    within the United States, including measuring and documenting the
    effectiveness of the policy -how to design a system for
    international trade that accounts for impacts on ecosystem services
    -how to develop a program that increases the American public's
    appreciation of the basic principles of ecosystem services

    Prospects for Resilience : Insights From New York City's Jamaica Bay
*Authors:*

    Adam S. Parris
*Publication Information:*

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Given the realities of climate change and sea-level rise, coastal
    cities around the world are struggling with questions of resilience.
    Resilience, at its core, is about desirable states of the urban
    social-ecological system and understanding how to sustain those
    states in an uncertain and tumultuous future. How do physical
    conditions, ecological processes, social objectives, human politics,
    and history shape the prospects for resilience? Most books set out
    “the answer.” This book sets out a process of grappling with
    holistic resilience from multiple perspectives, drawing on the
    insights and experiences of more than fifty scholars and
    practitioners working together to make Jamaica Bay in New York City
    an example for the world. Prospects for Resilience establishes a
    framework for understanding resilience practice in urban watersheds.
    Using Jamaica Bay—the largest contiguous natural area in New York,
    home to millions of New Yorkers, and a hub of global air travel with
    John F. Kennedy International Airport—the authors demonstrate how
    various components of social-ecological systems interact, ranging
    from climatic factors to plant populations to human demographics.
    They also highlight essential tools for creating resilient
    watersheds, including monitoring and identifying system indicators;
    computer modeling; green infrastructure; and decision science
    methods. Finally, they look at the role and importance of a
    “boundary organization” like the new Science and Resilience
    Institute at Jamaica Bay in coordinating and facilitating resilience
    work, and consider significant research questions and prospects for
    the future of urban watersheds. Prospects for Resilience sets forth
    an essential foundation of information and advice for researchers,
    urban planners, students and others who need to create more
    resilient cities that work with, not against, nature.

*Title:*
    Handbook of Biophilic City Planning & Design
*Authors:*
    Timothy Beatley
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, DC : Island Press. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    What if, even in the heart of a densely developed city, people could
    have meaningful encounters with nature? While parks, street trees,
    and green roofs are increasingly appreciated for their technical
    services like stormwater reduction, from a biophilic viewpoint, they
    also facilitate experiences that contribute to better physical and
    mental health: natural elements in play areas can lessen children's
    symptoms of ADHD, and adults who exercise in natural spaces can
    experience greater reductions in anxiety and blood pressure. The
    Handbook of Biophilic City Planning & Design offers practical advice
    and inspiration for ensuring that nature in the city is more than
    infrastructure—that it also promotes well-being and creates an
    emotional connection to the earth among urban residents. Divided
    into six parts, the Handbook begins by introducing key ideas,
    literature, and theory about biophilic urbanism. Chapters highlight
    urban biophilic innovations in more than a dozen global cities. The
    final part concludes with lessons on how to advance an agenda for
    urban biophilia and an extensive list of resources. As the most
    comprehensive reference on the emerging field of biophilic urbanism,
    the Handbook is essential reading for students and practitioners
    looking to place nature at the core of their planning and design
    ideas and encourage what preeminent biologist E.O. Wilson described
    as'the innate emotional connection of humans to all living things.'

    The Quality of Growth in Africa
*Series:*
    Initiative for Policy Dialogue at Columbia: Challenges in
    Development and Globalization
*Authors:*
    Akbar Noman
    Joseph E. Stiglitz
    Ravi Kanbur
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Columbia University Press. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In recent years, concerns about the outcomes and nature of economic
    growth have given way to a new emphasis on its quality. This volume
    brings together prominent international contributors to consider a
    range of interrelated questions concerning the quality of growth in
    Africa, with a primary focus on sub-Saharan countries.Contributors
    discuss the measurement of growth, the transformations necessary to
    sustain it, and issues around equity and well-being. They consider
    topics such as the distribution of income gains from growth; the
    extent to which economic growth has resulted in improvements in
    employment, poverty, and security; structural transformations of the
    economy and diversification of the sources of growth; environmental
    sustainability; and management of urbanization. Offering both
    diagnoses and prescriptions, The Quality of Growth in Africa helps
    envision a future that goes beyond increasing GDP to ensuring that
    growth translates into advancements in well-being. Although the book
    focuses on sub-Saharan Africa, much of the contributors'incisive
    analysis has implications for countries outside the region.

    Climate, Capitalism and Communities : An Anthropology of
    Environmental Overheating
*Authors:*
    Astrid B. Stensrud
    Thomas Hylland Eriksen
*Publication Information:*
    London : Pluto Press. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Until now, the growing body of work on environmental anthropology
    has largely ignored the unavoidable impact of global capitalism on
    the environment and the extent to which capital itself is a key
    driver of climate change. Climate, Capitalism and Communities
    focuses explicitly on that nexus, examining the injustices and
    inequalities - as well as the activist responses - that have arisen
    as a result, and the contradictions between the imperatives of
    exponential economic growth, and those of environmental
    sustainability, and society as a whole. Bringing an innovative,
    ethnographic toolkit to bear on a crisis that is at once global and
    highly localised, the authors shift attention away from the
    consequences of climate change, to a focus on the social relations
    and power structures that continue to prevent effective action.

    EDUQUALITY: Human Centered Quality Management in Education. A Model
    for Deployment, Assessment and Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Maria-Teresa Lepeley
*Publication Information:*
    Charlotte : Information Age Publishing. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    We, educators, are often so involved in daily teaching duties that
    lack time to absorb the broader picture of what is happening beyond
    our classrooms in a rapidly changing world. That is the norm in our
    profession. But our responsibility is to constantly improve the
    wellbeing of all the students enrolled in our classes. Education is
    the most important and most challenging profession there is.
    Educators shape future leaders, heroes, and people who can improve
    the world. Transformational educators have long term effects in the
    lives of students that projects on nations. On the opposite side,
    students waste time sitting in a classroom and can hamper future
    opportunities in life when educators fail to motivate them to assume
    responsibility for improving their wellbeing and build a better
    world for all. Education is not just another profession, it is an
    extraordinary endeavor with surmounting human responsibility to
    transform lives for the better. To claim the merit of education,
    educators must project education beyond school border into the
    context of society and the economy. To miss this context is a
    pending challenge. We, educators, need to earn the merit we deserve.
    But we now know that we earn merit with knowledge how to manage for
    quality and continuous improvement aiming at results leading to
    sustainability and working systematically to reach high standards.
    Lepeley, author of numerous publications on the subject, former
    examiner of the US Baldrige National Quality Award and adviser to
    NQAs in six countries in Latin America, presented her quality
    management model for education in the World Bank Global Network in
    the early 2000's. Her model has pioneered integration of education
    with other disciplines and other sectors projecting the importance
    and impact of education on sustainable development. The author
    emphasizes that neglecting the surmounting demand for quality will
    impair education as a fundamental factor of development, harm the
    worth of educators, undermine the profession and dent the wellbeing
    of human beings in inclusive nations and a peaceful world.

    Case Studies in Sustainability Management and Strategy : The Oikos
    Collection
*Authors:*
    Jost Hamschmidt
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2007
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    With the rapidly growing importance of sustainability and corporate
    responsibility in a globalised world, management schools are
    increasingly integrating long-term economic, environmental and
    social issues into their teaching and research. Climate change,
    poverty, labour standards and human rights are among the many topics
    that future decision-makers will need to face in their careers.
    Business education needs to reflect this new reality and provide a
    broadened understanding of value creation in order to create
    economic capital while developing social and preserving natural
    capital. Many sustainability trends also offer interesting new
    business opportunities that are ripe for entrepreneurial thinking.
    Case studies can be important tools for creating learning processes
    on different levels - students are forced to struggle with exactly
    the kinds of decisions and dilemmas managers confront every day. In
    this reflection of reality, the values and goals of the student are
    systematically challenged. This can be especially valuable in the
    context of sustainability and strategy - organisations are now
    continually forced to value the different aspects of sustainability
    and their interrelations: How do social issues impact the economic
    bottom line? How can an environmentally sound strategy create a
    positive impact on employee motivation and thus have measurable
    impact on economic performance? What comes first and why? But
    excellent case studies for management education in the field of
    sustainability management and strategy are rare. This innovative
    collection has been produced to fill this gap. It is based on the
    winning cases of an annual competition organised by oikos - the
    international Student Organization for Sustainable Economics and
    Management. So what makes an excellent case in sustainability
    management? These cases have been highly praised because they
    provide excellent learning opportunities, tell engaging stories,
    deal with recent situations, include quotations from key actors, are
    thought-provoking and controversial, require decision-making and
    provide clear take-aways. These cases explore both the opportunities
    and pitfalls companies and NGOs face in targeting sustainability
    issues and how their values and core assumptions impact their
    business strategies. They deal with a myriad of issues including
    supply chain management, stakeholder dialogue, social
    entrepreneurship, sustainable marketing, ethics, governance, the
    business case for sustainability, partnerships, purchasing and
    climate change. Case Studies in Sustainability Management and
    Strategy is an essential purchase for educators and is likely to be
    a widely used as a course textbook at all levels of management
    education. Online Teaching Notes to accompany each chapter are
    available on request with the purchase of the book.

    present their selection and understanding of these issues in eight
    chapters of this book. All of these chapters focus on some aspects
    of interaction between society and the environment from the
    viewpoint of the social sciences or humanities. The academic
    background of the authors is quite diverse, it includes philosophy,
    pedagogics, sociology, law, economy, environmental studies, and
    ecology. The chapters cover diff erent aspects of social development
    and relationship to the environment, including theoretical
    considerations and case studies of public perception of
    environmental issues, education for sustainability, economic
    alternatives, energy demand, or urban agriculture. The chapters
    raise many questions and sketch some answers to the question „What
    are the main current challenges of Central Europe?“

    Principles for Responsible Management Education Collection

    Kemi Ogunyemi
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *1st ed. [New York, N.Y.] [222 East 46th Street, New York, NY
    10017] : Business Expert Press. 2013

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Does a manager in today's world need to know anything about freedom?
    Or about instrinsic goods? Or even about educating emotions?
    “Absolutely,” says author Kemi Ogunyemi. Kemi wrote this book to
    serve as a valuable tool to complement courses on ethics,
    responsibility, leadership, human behavior in organizations,
    customer service, and sustainability—most of which tend to ignore
    their human nature dimensions. Inside, you'll be provided an indepth
    understanding of human nature and its uniqueness and complexity,
    which can greatly enhance your managerial skills for achieving
    business success in today's world. You will be empowered to better
    manage yourself, others, and the environment. This book also
    provides a foundation for developing ethical sensitivity and
    corporate social responsibility. There is a clear and present danger
    that managers may tend to focus primarily on financial success in
    different key dimensions—operational quality, financial strategy,
    workforce motivation, cost-cutting strategies, etc.—and perhaps
    discover too late the neglect of an even more vital dimension of all
    human endeavor. Future leaders and shapers of sustainable
    organizations and societies cannot afford to have such a knowledge gap.

*Description:*
    This volume illuminates the encounter of feminist activism with
    scholarship in political science, cultural studies, sociology,
    ethnic studies, and economics. The essays contribute images of the
    forces that lead to the development of many different kinds of
    feminisms and womens movements across the globe in the 20th century
    and recently. They explore the cultural constructions and
    legitimations of sustainability during the processes through which
    various agents interpret the relevance of feminisms for their social
    and political initiatives. The volume offers new dimensions on the
    relationships across time and place among activisms and
    scholarships, as ways to contemplate how feminisms are sustainable
    and whether there is a future beyond sustainability. This book gives
    a genealogical account of various different kinds of feminisms. It
    offers new dimensions on the relationships across time and place
    among activisms and scholarships. It investigates and discusses how
    feminisms are sustainable.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Industrial policy, once relegated to resource allocation,
    technological improvements, and the modernization of industries,
    should be treated as a serious component of sustainability and
    developmental economics. A rich set of complimentary institutions,
    shared behavioral norms, and public policies have sustained economic
    growth from Britain's industrial revolution onwards. This volume
    revisits the role of industrial policy in the success of these
    strategies and what it can offer developed and developing economies
    today. Featuring essays from experts invested in the expansion of
    industrial policies, topics discussed include the most effective use
    of industrial policies in learning economies, development finance,
    and promoting investment in regional and global contexts. Also
    included are in-depth case studies of Japan and India's experience
    with industrial policy in the banking and private sector. One essay
    revisits the theoretical and conceptual foundations of industrial
    policy from a structural economics perspective and another describes
    the models, packages, and transformation cycles that constitute a
    variety of approaches to implementation. The collection concludes
    with industrial strategies for facilitating quality growth,
    realizing more sustainable manufacturing development, and
    encouraging countries to industrialize around their natural resources.

*Description:*
    'Almost two-thirds of land in Australia has been modified for human
    use, primarily for grazing on natural vegetation. Clearing of native
    vegetation continues to occur for agriculture, plantation forestry,
    and urban development. Over the past two centuries, as land use has
    intensified for a growing population in this arid land, vast areas
    of native vegetation have been cleared or degraded, resulting in
    adverse affects on biodiversity, soil and water quality and the
    spread of weeds, feral pests and diseases. This book examines the
    damaging impacts of Australia's land use and agricultural activity,
    and proposes improvements to current farming systems. To ensure
    long-term sustainability, how do land managers consider the
    economic, social and environmental factors? 1 chapter: Land
    management in Australia. Also includes: Worksheets and activities ;

*Description:*
    Sustainability defines the need for any society to live within the
    constraints of the land's capacity to deliver all natural resources
    the society consumes. This book compares the general differences
    between Native Americans and western world view towards resources.
    It will provide the ‘nuts and bolts'of a sustainability portfolio
    designed by indigenous peoples. This book introduces the ideas on
    how to link nature and society to make sustainable choices. To be
    sustainable, nature and its endowment needs to be linked to human
    behavior similar to the practices of indigenous peoples. The main
    goal of this book is to facilitate thinking about how to change
    behavior and to integrate culture into thinking and decision-processes.

    Sustainable Innovation : The Organisational, Human and Knowledge
    Dimension
*Authors:*
    René Jorna
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2006
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    HOW SUSTAINABLE IS INNOVATION? Problematically, most contemporary
    patterns of innovation in human social systems and organisations are
    not sustainable. This prevents people from learning effectively,
    from recognising and solving their problems, and from operating in
    sustainable ways. It is arguably why societies, businesses and
    industries around the world are so unsustainable. Sustainable
    innovation is a pattern of social learning and problem-solving that
    is, itself, sustainable. The sustainability of innovation, moreover,
    is linked to the sustainability of its outcomes, which manifest
    themselves in what people produce and do in the world. Sustainable
    innovation, then, is a necessary precondition for sustainability in
    how societies and organisations function – the ways they organise,
    the products and services they make, the energy and resources they
    use, and the wastes they produce. As challenges such as demographic
    pressures, ethnic tensions, terrorism, global poverty, pandemics and
    abrupt climate change force their way into mainstream politics and
    business, so we see growing interest in innovation, entrepreneurial
    solutions and, critically, issues such as how to ensure successful
    solutions replicate and scale. Sustainable Innovation aims to
    illustrate that shift. Instead of simply focusing on environmental
    and technological matters, it views and evaluates
    innovation-for-sustainability in terms of the human, social and
    management challenges and responses. It argues that a just,
    efficient and sustainable balancing of these elements is best
    achieved by the development of new knowledge, and by the evolution
    of better means both of embedding that emerging knowledge in
    organisations and institutions, and of managing the relevant flows
    of information, knowledge and wisdom. The book stresses that claims
    that a particular product, production process or service are
    sustainable usually assume that an appropriate balance has been
    achieved between people, planet and profit. However, calculating the
    sustainability of such things, let alone of complex systems such as
    enterprises or economies, can be impossible. Instead
    of'sustainability', the book favours the use of terms such as'making
    sustainable', emphasising that in dynamic operating environments
    organisational processes are changing constantly, whether or not
    they are under effective strategic control by management.
    Innovation, too, is dynamic by definition. Sustainable Innovation
    argues that there must be a constant focus on the triple bottom line
    of economic, social and environmental value creation during the
    innovation process. Sustainable innovation is a new challenge for
    organisations. It is a process that should permeate the whole
    organisation, in terms of its members, its tasks, its coordination
    mechanisms and its procedures. Waste or pollution should not be seen
    as the reason for further intervention downstream, but as an
    end-of-the-pipe effect, which could be organisationally cured
    upstream. Developed from the Dutch research programme'Knowledge
    Creation for Sustainable Innovation', this book presents empirical
    research and cases to develop a theory of sustainable innovation
    that is based on management of knowledge, knowledge and cognition
    and innovation approaches. Sustainable Innovation suggests that
    knowledge and innovation will be the key drivers of social and
    corporate sustainability in the years ahead. It will be essential
    reading for managers and researchers in areas such as
    sustainability, innovation, knowledge management and organisational
    learning.

    Institutional Barriers to Sustainable Transport
*Authors:*
    Carey Curtis
    Nicholas Low
*Publication Information:*
    Burlington, VT : Routledge. 2012
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In a world seeking to tackle global environmental problems such as
    climate change, the importance of local and national institutional
    change to deal most effectively with these issues is critical. This
    book presents an investigation of the institutional barriers
    preventing the development of a new vision for urban transport
    compatible with these realities and in those terms'sustainable'.
    Through an examination of transport planning in Australia, the book
    challenges conventional wisdom by showing, through original
    research, how'car dependence'is as much an institutional as a
    technical phenomenon. The authors'case studies in three metropolitan
    cities show how transport policy has become institutionally fixated
    on a path dominated by private, road-based transport and how policy
    systems become encrusted around investment to accommodate private
    cars, erecting an impenetrable barrier against more sustainable
    mobility and accessibility solutions. Representing a new approach to
    understanding transport policy, this book brings sophisticated
    political-institutional analysis to what has traditionally been the
    domain of engineering and technology. The authors connect the
    empirical content to this theory and the issue of sustainability
    making the findings applicable to most cities of the developed
    world, and to fields beyond transport planning. A strategy and
    program of action is outlined to take advantage of changing public
    perceptions and aimed at creating a new vision for urban transport.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Rural tourism represents a merging of perhaps two of the most
    influential yet contradictory features of modern life. Not only are
    the forces of economic, social, cultural, environmental and
    political change working to redefine rural spaces the world over,
    but broad global transformations in consumption and transportation
    patterns are reshaping leisure behaviour and travel. For those
    concerned with both the nature of change in rural areas and tourism
    development, the dynamics and impacts of integrating these two
    dramatic shifts are not well known but yet are becoming increasingly
    provocative discourses for study. This book links changes at the
    local, rural community level to broader, more structural
    considerations of globalization and allows for a deeper, more
    theoretically sophisticated consideration of the various forces and
    features of rural tourism development. While Canadian in content,
    the cases and discussions presented in this book can be considered
    generally relevant to any rural region, continentally and globally,
    that has undertaken or is considering rural tourism development.

*Description:*
    Given the world-wide ecological crisis, to what extent do the
    current economic systems of production and consumption need to
    change? To make substantial changes to the dominant economic system
    as the author proposes, area new politics required? What are the
    relations between economic and political changes? M. Athena
    Palaeologu's lucid and engaging analysis offers concrete proposals
    for moving beyond our current social and environmental impasse. In
    market-driven economies around the world ecological crises are
    creating major problems of supply and distribution. The inability of
    governments to manage these environmental problems both domestically
    and internationally has led to widespread contradictions between
    public rhetoric and political practice. A growing number of
    contemporary publications respond to these crises by advocating a
    successful marriage of the corporate marketplace with the goals of
    environmentalism, in a marketing landscape where large and small
    corporations are tripping over each other to present their
    “green”credentials. M. Athena Palaeologu's timely work Green
    Politics,Green Economics examines these apologetic responses to
    broach an uncomfortable but fundamental question–is long-term and
    sustainable development really possible under market capitalism?
    Palaeologu develops two alternative approaches to these
    environmental challenges: (i) a“green politics”that places major
    importance on achieving ecological goals through grassroots
    participatory citizen involvement, drawing heavily on values shared
    with feminist and social movements, and; (ii) a“green economics”that
    address the dynamic and spatial interdependence between human
    economies and the natural ecosystems which sustain them. The focus
    of both of these approaches is the“scale”conundrum: how are we to
    implement a green economics capable of realising development within
    the ecological constraints of our planet's biosphere?

*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Bingley, UK : Emerald Group Publishing
    Limited. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book offers African, Asian, Latin American, European, and North
    American perspectives on institutions and regulations promoting
    sustainable economic growth in the post-2015 development agenda in
    areas such as environment, labour, risk management, corporate social
    responsibility, corporate governance, and innovation. The chapters
    address sustainability issues at the firm, national, regional and
    international levels from a multidisciplinary perspective. The
    chapters of this volume address the challenge of enhancing economic
    competitiveness of the supply side economies while pushing a
    sustainable development agenda. This work addresses the existing
    inequalities, environmental degradation, and economic/financial
    instability under current dynamics of international and domestic
    power relations in order to meet the set objectives for the
    post-2015 era. This volume advances the perspectives on the
    non-compulsory alternative to markets regulations, the United
    Nations Global Compact, explored in the previous volume'The UN
    Global Compact: Fair Competition and Environmental and Labour
    Justice in International Markets'vol. 16.

*Title:*
    Conservation for Cities : How to Plan & Build Natural Infrastructure
*Authors:*
    Robert I. McDonald
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, DC : Island Press. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    It's time to think differently about cities and nature.
    Understanding how to better connect our cities with the benefits
    nature provides will be increasingly important as people migrate to
    cities and flourish in them. All this urban growth, along with
    challenges of adapting to climate change, will require a new
    approach to infrastructure if we're going to be successful. Yet
    guidance on how to plan and implement projects to protect or restore
    natural infrastructure is often hard to come by. With Conservation
    for Cities, Robert McDonald offers a comprehensive framework for
    maintaining and strengthening the supporting bonds between cities
    and nature through innovative infrastructure projects. After
    presenting a broad approach to incorporating natural infrastructure
    priorities into urban planning, he focuses each following chapter on
    a specific ecosystem service. He describes a wide variety of
    benefits, and helps practitioners answer fundamental questions: What
    are the best ecosystem services to enhance in a particular city or
    neighborhood? How might planners best combine green and grey
    infrastructure to solve problems facing a city? What are the
    regulatory and policy tools that can help fund and implement
    projects? Finally, McDonald explains how to develop a cost-effective
    mix of grey and green infrastructure and offers targeted advice on
    quantifying the benefits. Written by one of The Nature Conservancy's
    lead scientists on cities and natural infrastructure, Conservation
    for Cities is a book that ecologists, planners, and landscape
    architects will turn to again and again as they plan and implement a
    wide variety of projects.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Product lifetimes are critical for the circular economy, resource
    efficiency, waste reduction and low carbon strategies for
    sustainability, and are therefore of interest to academics from many
    different disciplines as well as original equipment manufacturers
    (OEMs) and other stakeholders. The challenges related to product
    lifetimes must be tackled from multiple perspectives, making the
    sharing of knowledge and expertise from different disciplines
    particularly important. This book presents papers from the second
    Product Lifetime and the Environment (PLATE) conference, held in
    Delft, the Netherlands, in November 2017. The conference originated
    from the desire to bring together academic researchers working in
    the field of sustainability to benefit from each other's knowledge
    and further advance the field. The book includes the 88 full papers
    delivered at the conference, grouped according to the following 7
    conference themes: design for product longevity; product lifetime
    optimization; cultural perspectives on the throwaway society;
    circular economy and product lifetimes; business opportunities,
    economic implications and marketing strategies; consumer influences
    on product lifetimes; and policy, regulation and legislation. The
    book will be of interest to all those concerned with sustainable
    consumption, circular economy and resource efficiency.

    Living Sustainably : What Intentional Communities Can Teach Us About
    Democracy, Simplicity, and Nonviolence
*Series:*
    Culture of the Land
*Authors:*
    A. Whitney Sanford
*Publication Information:*
    Lexington, Kentucky : The University Press of Kentucky. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In light of concerns about food and human health, fraying social
    ties, economic uncertainty, and rampant consumerism, some people are
    foregoing a hurried, distracted existence and embracing a mindful
    way of living. Intentional residential communities across the United
    States are seeking the freedom to craft their own societies and live
    based on the values of nonviolence, self-sufficiency, equality, and
    voluntary simplicity.In Living Sustainably, A. Whitney Sanford
    reveals the solutions that such communities have devised for
    sustainable living while highlighting the specific choices and
    adaptations that they have made to accommodate local context and
    geography. She examines their methods of reviving and adapting
    traditional agrarian skills, testing alternate building materials
    for their homes, and developing local governments that balance group
    needs and individual autonomy. Living Sustainably is a teachable
    testament to the idea that new cultures based on justice and
    sustainability are attainable in many ways. Sanford's engaging work
    demonstrates that citizens can make a conscious effort to subsist in
    a more balanced, harmonious world.

*Description:*
    This book—an outcome of the authors'ongoing research on the complex
    relationships between humans and water in an urban context—presents
    an integrated model for assessing and forecasting the sustainability
    of human settlements, particularly urban communities. After
    introducing the conceptual and contextual dimensions of
    sustainability through an extensive review of the literature on the
    subject, the authors go on to explain their model. They then
    elaborate on the methodology for its formulation, development and
    implementation. This model has also been used to analyse changes in
    the availability of water and open spaces, and variations in
    lifestyles, community attitudes and living conditions including
    sanitation practices, and waste generation and its disposal.

    Environmental Principles and the Evolution of Environmental Law
*Authors:*
    Eloise Scotford
*Publication Information:*
    Oxford [UK] : Hart Publishing. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Environmental principles – from the polluter pays and precautionary
    principles to the principles of integration and sustainability –
    proliferate in domestic and international legal and policy
    discourse, reflecting key goals of environmental protection and
    sustainable development on which there is apparent political
    consensus. Environmental principles also have a high profile in
    environmental law, beyond their popularity as policy and political
    concepts, as ideas that might unify the subject and provide it with
    conceptual foundations or boost its delivery of environmental
    outcomes. However, environmental principles are elusive legal
    concepts. This book deepens the legal understanding of environmental
    principles in light of recent legal developments. It analyses the
    increasing legal effects of environmental principles in different
    jurisdictions and demonstrates how they are shaping and revealing
    innovative and evolving bodies of environmental law. This analysis
    is a step forward in understanding a key feature of modern
    environmental law and presents a robust methodology for dealing with
    novel legal concepts in the subject. It also makes a contribution to
    environmental policy debates and discussions internationally that
    rely heavily on environmental principles, including their supposed
    legal effects.

*Description:*
    Engineering, Social Justice, and Sustainable Community Development
    is the first in a series of biennial workshops on the theme of
    engineering ethics and engineering leadership. This workshop
    addresses conflicting positive goals for engineering projects in
    impoverished areas and areas in crisis. These conflicts arise
    domestically as well as in international arenas. The goals of
    project sponsors and participants, which are often implicit, include
    protecting human welfare, ensuring social justice, and striving for
    environmental sustainability alongside the more often explicit goal
    of economic development or progress. The workshop, summarized in
    this volume, discussed how to achieve the following: Improve
    research in engineering ethics. Improve engineering practice in
    situations of crisis and conflict. Improve engineering education in
    ethics and social issues. Involve professional societies in these
    efforts.

*Authors:*
    Michael Kenny
    James Meadowcroft
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2002
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Environmental sustainability has become one of the most salient
    issues on the policy agenda of nation-states. This book argues that
    planning is seldom credited by advocates of environmental politics.
    The authors, leading scholars in the field, explore the relationship
    between environmental sustainability - one of the most important
    innovations in recent political discourse and planning, an idea
    which has slipped from public attention recently.

    Design for Sustainability : A Sourcebook of Integrated Ecological
    Solutions
*Authors:*
    Janis Birkeland
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2002
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    With radical and innovative design solutions, everyone could be
    living in buildings and settlements that are more like gardens than
    cargo containers, and that purify air and water, generate energy,
    treat sewage and produce food - at lower cost. Birkeland introduces
    systems design thinking that cuts across academic and professional
    boundaries and the divide between social and physical sciences to
    move towards a transdiciplinary approach to environmental and social
    problem-solving. This sourcebook is useful for teaching, as each
    topic within the field of environmental management and social change
    has pairs of short readings providing diverse perspectives to
    compare, contrast and debate. Design for Sustainability presents
    examples of integrated systems design based on ecological principles
    and concepts and drawn from the foremost designers in the fields of
    industrial design, materials, housing design, urban planning and
    transport, landscape and permaculture, and energy and resource
    management.

    Sustainable Value : How the World's Leading Companies Are Doing Well
    by Doing Good
*Authors:*
    Laszlo, Christopher
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2008
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    A small but influential group of mainstream global industry leaders
    are now reinventing the role of business in society. They are
    shifting the focus away from minimizing negative impacts to offering
    new solutions to global problems that the public sector has been
    unable to tackle alone. In this new competitive environment,
    societal challenges such as climate change or the alleviation of
    global poverty are not only risks, but huge business opportunities,
    not only for niche players, but for mainstream business. These
    leaders are creating'Sustainable Value'. They are creating it
    through the provision of value to both their shareholders and their
    stakeholders – an ever-growing list of diverse constituents impacted
    by the social, environmental, and financial performance of global
    business. In short, they are doing well by doing good. In this
    outstanding book, Chris Laszlo defines, illustrates, and shows how
    business can action'Sustainable Value'in three profoundly different
    ways. First, a management fable looks at the experiences of a
    dynamic business leader as she grapples with the new business
    realities of managing stakeholder, as well as shareholder pressures.
    Second, with the real thing – inside stories from some of the
    largest corporations in the world that are successfully integrating
    sustainability into their core activities, not only from a sense of
    moral correctness, but because it makes good business sense. And,
    finally, with frameworks, tools, and methods that will make
    sustainable value creation concrete for business practitioners
    everywhere. This book is a masterful synthesis – part novel and part
    executive briefing – a refreshing kind of prophetic pragmatism,
    helping leaders anticipate and see the future in the context of the
    actual. In Sustainable Value Chris Laszlo speaks with resounding
    clarity to the living challenges, the real dilemmas, and haunting
    questions of CEOs everywhere.

    The Economics of Air Pollution in China : Achieving Better and
    Cleaner Growth
*Authors:*
    Jun Ma
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Columbia University Press. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Suffocating smog regularly envelops Chinese metropolises from
    Beijing to Shanghai, clouding the future prospect of China's growth
    sustainability. Air pollutants do not discriminate between the rich
    and the poor, the politician and the'average Joe.'They put
    everyone's health and economic prosperity at risk, creating future
    costs that are difficult to calculate. Yet many people, including
    some in China, are concerned that addressing environmental
    challenges will jeopardize economic growth. In The Economics of Air
    Pollution in China, leading Chinese economist Ma Jun makes the case
    that the trade-off between growth and environment is not inevitable.
    In his ambitious proposal to tackle severe air pollution and
    drastically reduce the level of so-called PM 2.5
    particles—microscopic pollutants that lodge deeply in lungs—Ma Jun
    argues that in targeting pollution, China has a real opportunity to
    undertake significant structural economic reforms that would support
    long-term growth. Rooted in rigorous analyses and evidence-based
    projections, Ma Jun's'big bang'proposal aims to mitigate pollution
    and facilitate a transition to a greener and more sustainable growth
    model.

    Humanity's Footprint : Momentum, Impact, and Our Global Environment
*Authors:*
    Walter K Dodds
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Columbia University Press. 2008
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    For the first time in history, humans have exceeded the sustaining
    capacity of Earth's global ecosystems. Our expanding footprint has
    tremendous momentum, and the insidious explosion of human impact
    creates a shockwave that threatens ecosystems worldwide for
    decades-possibly centuries.Walter K. Dodds depicts in clear,
    nontechnical terms the root causes and global environmental effects
    of human behavior. He describes trends in population growth,
    resource use, and global environmental impacts of the past two
    centuries, such as greenhouse effects, ozone depletion, water
    pollution, and species extinctions and introductions. Dodds also
    addresses less familiar developments, such as the spread of
    antibiotic resistant genes in bacteria and the concentration of
    pesticides in the Arctic and other remote ecosystems. He identifies
    fundamental human activities that have irreversible effects on the
    environment and draws on recent social science and game theory
    results to explain why people use more than their share. Past
    behavior indicates that as resources grow scarce, humans will
    escalate their use of what remains instead of managing their
    consumption. Humanity's Footprint paints a lively but ultimately
    sobering picture of our environmental predicament. Dodds calls for a
    consilient approach to socioenvironmental restoration that draws on
    new thinking from across disciplines to develop sustainable
    solutions to global environmental problems.

    Social Banks and the Future of Sustainable Finance
*Series:*
    Routledge International Studies in Money and Banking
*Authors:*
    Olaf Weber
    Sven Remer
*Publication Information:*
    Abingdon, Oxon : Routledge. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Social Banking describes a way of value-driven banking that has a
    positive social and ecological impact at its heart, as well as its
    own economic sustainability. Although it has a long and successful
    history, it has arguably never been more topical than it is now in
    the aftermath of the latest financial crisis. Most Social Banks came
    out of this crisis not only unscathed but much stronger and bigger
    than they were before. And contrary to their conventional peers,
    none of the Social Banks had to be bailed out with public funds.
    This increasingly attracts the interest not only of clients
    searching for safe and sensible ways to deposit their funds but also
    of conventional banks that begin to understand the potential of a
    more socially oriented approach towards banking. Social Banks and
    the Future of Sustainable Finance is the first book to deliver a
    comprehensive and detailed overview about the past, present and
    possible future of Social and Sustainable Banking for researchers,
    students and a professional audience. The authors are experts from
    research and practice and have bee involved in Social Banking for
    many years. Thus they combine state-of-the-art expertise with
    valuable insider knowledge. The book covers the following topics:
    the history of Social Banking, the need for Social Banking in the
    current economy, the particular issues of managing a Social Bank as
    business enterprise, Social Banking products and services, the
    special role of donations and foundations for financing change, the
    opportunities and challenges for Social Banks lying ahead, and
    concrete directions for the future of Social Banking. In addition to
    these respective analyses are many real-world examples and
    interviews with representatives of Social Banks. As such, this
    comprehensive collection delivers valuable insights for academics,
    students and professionals who are interested in the growing field
    of Social Banking.

    Teaching Business Sustainability Vol. 2 : Cases, Simulations and
    Experiential Approaches
*Series:*
    Teaching Business Sustainability, v. 2
*Authors:*
    Chris Galea
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2007
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    If there is one area of business education that requires
    out-of-the-box, creative thinking it is sustainability. Business
    sustainability, because of its relative newness (and hence
    uncertainty), its dependence on interdisciplinary thinking, its need
    to work with different stakeholders and its non-traditional
    operating approaches, demands that we train our managers in wholly
    new ways. This need for new and non-traditional teaching approaches
    is reflected in this collection of unorthodox teaching pedagogies.
    The underlying philosophy behind them is that deep learning for
    sustainability needs ultimately to be experiential: that is,
    learning while doing rather than a passive absorption of facts and
    figures. While much of the underlying theory of sustainability may
    be taught using more traditional lecture and reading approaches, the
    implementation of true business sustainability requires students to
    experiment – to win and lose – while grappling with the myriad
    challenges and frustrations posed by sustainability: the same
    challenges and frustrations, one might add, that companies intent on
    implementing sustainability face on a daily basis in the world in
    which they operate. The aim is to create a learning environment
    where students themselves take control over their own learning. This
    book – a companion volume to Teaching Business Sustainability 1:
    From Theory to Practice (Greenleaf Publishing, 2004) – focuses on
    four main categories of experiential pedagogy: case studies,
    hands-on exercises, role-play simulations and active learning
    teaching exercises. It includes contributions from a range of
    experts in global sustainability education who provide their
    expertise with class-hardened teaching materials. Teaching Business
    Sustainability 2 will be an invaluable resource both for educators
    working in a wide range of academic disciplines, looking for
    inspiration and guidance on how to teach business sustainability, as
    well as for organisations looking to reinvigorate internal
    management education programmes to factor in corporate
    responsibility and sustainability issues.

    'Sustainable Justice and the Community'is an attempt to locate
    justice in a workable and sustainable way within the community,
    introducing'Sustainable Justice'as a key concept for the coming
    century. This volume is a critical examination of three key concepts
    which need to be understood for the management of today's flexible
    and fluid society, namely Sustainability, Justice and Community.
    Within this study, we seek to explore both through an analysis built
    from their original philosophical understandings, through to their
    contemporary usage and application, ultimately developing new
    understandings through a combination of the essential thematic
    notions underpinning these salient concepts.

*Description:*
    Mechanisms of Landscape Rehabilitation and Sustainability is based
    on the results of landscape rehabilitation with the help of
    fabricated soil and a new approach on the use of restored soils for
    building houses and communities. This book presents discoveries and
    proposals that have emerged from the authors'research and explains
    ways to protect Earth's ecosystems against further degradation.
    These proposals are founded on the philosophy of sustainable
    development and its application to various aspects essential to the
    long-term success of human beings; these include community
    coexistence, education, water purification and recycling,
    agriculture, the production of fabricated soil for landscape
    rehabilitation, and the preservation and propagation of wild flora.
    Strategies for both indoor and outdoor systems are covered in this
    publication. The book covers several subjects including molecular
    biology, botany, microbiology, soil biochemistry and human
    interaction with the ecosystem. Methods for soil rehabilitation
    ultimately allow us to obtain optimal crop yield. Mechanisms of
    Landscape Rehabilitation and Sustainability is of particular
    interest to academic and professional biologists, soil scientists,
    ecologists, agronomists and architects.

*Description:*
    The complexity of transportation systems and their negative social
    and environmental effects are today at the centre of attention. This
    book focuses on the impact of institutions and regulatory systems on
    transport systems and travel behaviour. While institutions appear to
    play an important role in the economic success of many countries,
    this book considers the extent to which they also support
    sustainable development.

    Cities As Sustainable Ecosystems : Principles and Practices
*Authors:*
    Peter Newman
    Isabella Jennings
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C. : Island Press. 2008
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Modern city dwellers are largely detached from the environmental
    effects of their daily lives. The sources of the water they drink,
    the food they eat, and the energy they consume are all but
    invisible, often coming from other continents, and their waste ends
    up in places beyond their city boundaries. Cities as Sustainable
    Ecosystems shows how cities and their residents can begin to
    reintegrate into their bioregional environment, and how cities
    themselves can be planned with nature's organizing principles in
    mind. Taking cues from living systems for sustainability strategies,
    Newman and Jennings reassess urban design by exploring flows of
    energy, materials, and information, along with the interactions
    between human and non-human parts of the system. Drawing on examples
    from all corners of the world, the authors explore natural patterns
    and processes that cities can emulate in order to move toward
    sustainability. Some cities have adopted simple strategies such as
    harvesting rainwater, greening roofs, and producing renewable
    energy. Others have created biodiversity parks for endangered
    species, community gardens that support a connection to their
    foodshed, and pedestrian-friendly spaces that encourage walking and
    cycling. A powerful model for urban redevelopment, Cities as
    Sustainable Ecosystems describes aspects of urban ecosystems from
    the visioning process to achieving economic security to fostering a
    sense of place.

*Authors:*
    Richard B. Howarth
*Publication Information:*
    Madison, WI : University of Wisconsin Press. 1997
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The rising stature of sustainable development constitutes an
    important and evolving challenge for natural resource and
    environmental economics. Is sustainability best achieved through the
    use and extension of conventional criteria for optimal resource
    allocation? Or does the concept involve a more substantial shift
    beyond methods such as present-value maximization and nonmarket
    valuation? At the heart of this challenge lie questions concerning
    the precise meaning that should be attached to the phrase
    “sustainable development,” and how this concept may be
    operationalized in economic theory and applied policy analysis.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    How can civil society and global governors come together in new ways
    to improve links among trade, environmental and social values? In
    this important and wide-ranging volume, an unparalleled array of
    contributors examines the many new processes of civil society
    engagement that have been introduced at the local, regional and
    global levels. Assessing what more can be done to strengthen the
    productive partnerships between civil society and global governance,
    the book draws on the extensive inventory of existing practices and
    community-based alternatives to demonstrate how particular
    mechanisms for civil society participation in global governance have
    enhanced or impeded the specific economic, environmental and
    political outcomes that many seek to achieve.

    The New Consumers : The Influence Of Affluence On The Environment
*Authors:*
    Norman Myers
    Jennifer Kent
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C. : Island Press. 2004
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    While overconsumption by the developed world's roughly one billion
    inhabitants is an abiding problem, another one billion increasingly
    affluent'new consumers'in developing countries will place additional
    strains on the earth's resources, argue authors Norman Myers and
    Jennifer Kent in this important new book. The New Consumers examines
    the environmental impacts of this increased consumption, with
    particular focus on two commodities -- cars and meat -- that stand
    to have the most far-reaching effects. It analyzes consumption
    patterns in a number of different countries, with special emphasis
    on China and India (whose surging economies, as well as their large
    populations, are likely to account for exceptional growth in
    humanity's ecological footprint), and surveys big-picture issues
    such as the globalization of economies, consumer goods, and
    lifestyles. Ultimately, according to the orman Myers and Jennifer
    Kent, the challenge will be for all of humanity to transition to
    sustainable levels of consumption, for it is unrealistic to
    expect'new'consumers not to aspire to be like the'old'ones. Cogent
    in its analysis, The New Consumers issues a timely warning of a
    major and developing environmental trend, and suggests valuable
    strategies for ameliorating its effects.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Ownership-based economics has led to the rapid development and
    apparent universal success of the market economy. It is a system
    built on the deception of resource availability, ill-defined profit,
    and misled by the idea that an invisible hand can be an equitable
    system of distribution. It has resulted in a high living standard
    for a few select individuals, but at the expense of mankind and
    nature, ultimately culminating in the development of human
    conflict.This is a book with a blueprint for the twenty-first
    century, proposing a two-fold approach to easing the pressure on
    both the human race and the world we live in. It calls for a change
    of mindset from ownership to stewardship and a shift of
    responsibility to the corporate entities as a sub-system of the
    market economy.

*Description:*
    While the efficiency and sustainability offensive is in full swing
    in most sectors of the economy, in the construction sector it is
    still in its very beginnings – economically as well as ecologically.
    However, politicians and policymakers at the global, European, and
    national levels have begun to address this deficit and are seeking
    to correct it with legal requirements and laws like EnEV, building
    certifications, and competitions. Following the proven model of
    earlier manuals in the series, the Energy Manual presents a
    comprehensive look at the constructional parameters of energy
    efficiency and sustainability. It offers an advance look at the
    legal regulations being planned by the EU, and – as a tool ready for
    immediate use by architects, engineers, and designers in their daily
    work – it points the way toward the efficient and sustainable
    construction and operation of buildings. With its focus on the
    entire lifecycle of a building, it provides an integrated
    perspective – a necessary prerequisite for sustainable economic
    management.

    Ecuador's Environmental Revolutions : Ecoimperialists,
    Ecodependents, and Ecoresisters
*Authors:*
    Tammy L. Lewis
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge, MA : The MIT Press. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    An account of the movement for sustainable development in Ecuador
    through four eras: movement origins, neoliberal boom, neoliberal
    bust, and citizens'revolution.Ecuador is biologically diverse,
    petroleum rich, and economically poor. Its extraordinary
    biodiversity has attracted attention and funding from such
    transnational environmental organizations as Conservation
    International, the World Wildlife Fund, and the United States Agency
    for International Development. In Ecuador itself there are more than
    200 environmental groups dedicated to sustainable development, and
    the country's 2008 constitution grants constitutional rights to
    nature. The current leftist government is committed both to lifting
    its people out of poverty and pursuing sustainable development, but
    petroleum extraction is Ecuador's leading source of revenue. While
    extraction generates economic growth, which supports the state's
    social welfare agenda, it also causes environmental destruction.
    Given these competing concerns, will Ecuador be able to achieve
    sustainability? In this book, Tammy Lewis examines the movement for
    sustainable development in Ecuador through four eras: movement
    origins (1978 to 1987), neoliberal boom (1987 to 2000), neoliberal
    bust (2000 to 2006), and citizens'revolution (2006 to 2015).Lewis
    presents a typology of Ecuador's environmental organizations:
    ecoimperialists, transnational environmentalists from other
    countries; ecodependents, national groups that partner with
    transnational groups; and ecoresisters, home-grown environmentalists
    who reject the dominant development paradigm. She examines the
    interplay of transnational funding, the Ecuadorian environmental
    movement, and the state's environmental and development policies.
    Along the way, addressing literatures in environmental sociology,
    social movements, and development studies, she explores what
    configuration of forces—political, economic, and environmental—is
    most likely to lead to a sustainable balance between the social
    system and the ecosystem.

    Fostering Spirituality in the Workplace : A Leader's Guide to
    Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Priscilla Berry
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Business Expert Press. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Today, there are deep and rapid changes on companies, employees, and
    the global economy that should not be underestimated, and future
    world leaders must be prepared to lead in a manner that is socially
    responsible, ethical, and pro_ table. A corporation with a business
    model that polarizes or operates solely in the interest of its
    shareholders is unsustainable and current benchmarks can be
    unrealistic tools for businesses to rely upon as measures of future
    success. This book explores historical data, analyzes current events
    from the world stage, and delivers a worldview that challenges some
    existing paradigms in business. As we are living business history,
    the book draws from the epic economic, environmental, and cultural
    shifts in our collective consciousness. It begins a vital
    conversation by introducing some thought paradigms that will
    challenge current business practices, create a vision for the
    future, and provide a road map to navigate this uncharted territory.
    In the end, the author outlines specific action that you must take
    now to end the economic and moral decline in this first part of the
    21st century.

    Sustainable Development for Engineers : A Handbook and Resource Guide
*Authors:*
    Karel Mulder
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2006
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    It is crucial that engineers – from students to those already
    practising – have a deep understanding of the environmental threats
    facing the world, if they are to become part of the solution and not
    the problem. Is there a way to reconcile modern lifestyles with the
    compelling need for change? Could new improved technologies play a
    key role? If great leaps in the environmental efficiency of
    technologies are needed, can they be produced? Engineers are in a
    privileged and hugely influential position to innovate, design and
    build a sustainable future. But are they engaged or uninterested?
    Are they knowledgeable or ignorant? This book has been developed by
    a number of committed educators in European engineering departments
    under the leadership of Delft University of Technology and the
    Technical University of Catalunya to meet the perceived gap between
    what engineers know and what they should know in relation to
    sustainable development. The University of Delft decided as long ago
    as 1998 that all of its engineering graduates, working towards
    careers as designers, managers or researchers, should be prepared
    for the challenge of sustainable development and, as such, should
    leave university able to make sustainable development operational in
    their designs and daily practices. The huge amount of knowledge
    gathered on best-practice teaching for engineers is reflected in
    this book. The aim is to give engineering students a grounding in
    the challenge that sustainable development poses to the engineering
    profession, the contribution the engineer can make to attaining some
    of the societal and environmental goals of sustainability, and the
    barriers and pitfalls engineers will likely need to confront in
    their professional lives. Concise but comprehensive, the book
    examines the key tools, skills and techniques that can be used in
    engineering design and management to ensure that whole-life costs
    and impacts of engineering schemes are addressed at every stage of
    planning, implementation and disposal. The book also aims to
    demonstrate through real-life examples the tangible benefits that
    have already been achieved in many engineering projects, and to
    highlight how real improvements can be, and are being, made. Each
    chapter ends with a series of questions and exercises for the
    student to undertake. Sustainable Development for Engineers will be
    essential reading for all engineers and scientists concerned with
    sustainable development. In particular, it provides key reading and
    learning materials for undergraduate and postgraduate students
    reading environmental, chemical, civil or mechanical engineering,
    manufacturing and design, environmental science, green chemistry and
    environmental management.

    Sustainable Growth and Resource Productivity : Economic and Global
    Policy Issues
*Authors:*
    Raimund Bleischwitz
    Paul Welfens
    ZhongXiang Zhang
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Written by international experts in their respective fields,
    Sustainable Growth and Resource Productivity provides a
    comprehensive overview of global issues of raw materials supply and
    resource use. It also introduces new views and perspectives on the
    sustainable growth of emerging economies and develops a rationale
    for a new resource economics. This book emphasises why resources are
    back on the agenda: firstly, because of their fundamental economic
    role in technological progress and long-term prosperity; secondly,
    because deficits in raw material markets are now intertwined with
    deficits in the financial markets; and, thirdly, because the
    sustainable management of natural resources is a crucial element in
    responses to new global challenges such as climate change.
    Sustainable Growth and Resource Productivity analyses raw materials
    supply and resource use in a global context. The contributions
    present state-of-the-art results and perspectives on the
    availability of resources and discuss factors such as limited
    supply, demand from emerging and other economies and the critical
    shortage of some materials – particularly some metals – that are
    essential inputs in many high-tech processes and may put certain
    industries at risk. Sustainable Growth and Resource Productivity
    sheds new light on the economics of sustainable growth. Linking the
    current financial crisis with stock market pricing and innovation
    dynamics, it argues for reforms in international macro-economic
    policies. It also critically discusses the implications of valuing
    labour productivity over capital and resource productivity and
    argues that policies favouring capital productivity will increase
    both social and economic sustainability. Further contributions are
    made on the business dimensions of material efficiency as well as on
    policy recommendations. The book examines the overall empirical
    trend towards decoupling resource use from economic growth. It
    undertakes a rigorous cross-country comparison and looks in more
    detail at the cases of Finland and Greece, as well as at emerging
    economies and their role in the global governance of natural
    resources. A key focus is placed on China, with discussion of recent
    findings regarding Chinese domestic policy on energy, climate and
    resources as well as on developing Chinese foreign policy in Africa.
    The book concludes with the positing of a new theory of resource
    economics: an emerging sub-discipline that puts resources at its
    heart but clearly aligns with other fields of economics, and
    transcends the borderlines of geology, geography, material science,
    recycling and waste, as well as elements of other social sciences.
    This important new book will be essential reading for economic
    researchers, governmental officials, businesses and NGOs with an
    interest in understanding the policy links to sustainable growth and
    in learning more about the emerging field of resource productivity.

*Description:*
    Infrastructure and its effects on economic growth, social welfare,
    and sustainability receive a great deal of attention today. There is
    widespread agreement that infrastructure is a key dimension of
    global development and that its impact reaches deep into the broader
    economy with important and complex implications for social progress.
    At the same time, infrastructure finance is among the most complex
    and challenging areas in the global financial architecture. Ingo
    Walter, Professor of Finance, Corporate Governance and Ethics

*Title:*
    The Economics of Abundance : A Political Economy of Freedom, Equity,
    and Sustainability
*Series:*
    Gower Green Economics and Sustainable Growth Series
*Authors:*
    Wolfgang Hoeschele
*Publication Information:*
    Farnham : Routledge. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    No matter how many resources we consume we never seem to have
    enough. The Economics of Abundance is a balanced book in which
    Wolfgang Hoeschele challenges why this is so. He claims that our
    current capitalist economy can exist only on the basis of
    manufactured scarcity created by'scarcity-generating institutions',
    and these institutions manipulate both demand and supply of
    commodities. Therefore demand consistently exceeds supply, and
    profits and economic growth can continue - at the cost of individual
    freedom, social equity, and ecological sustainability. The fact that
    continual increases in demand are so vital to our economy leads to
    an impasse: many people see no alternative to the generation of ever
    more demand, but at the same time recognize that it is clearly
    unsustainable ecologically and socially. So, can demand only be
    reduced by curtailing freedom and is this acceptable? This book
    argues that, by analyzing how scarcity-generating institutions work
    and then reforming or dismantling them, we can enhance individual
    freedom and support entrepreneurial initiative, and at the same time
    make progress toward social justice and environmental sustainability
    by reducing demands on vital resources. This vision would enable
    activists in many fields (social justice, civil liberties, and
    environmental protection), as well as many entrepreneurs and other
    members of civil society to work together much more effectively,
    make it more difficult to portray all these groups as contradictory
    special interests, and thereby help generate momentum for positive
    change. Meanwhile, for academics in many fields of study, the
    concept of the creation of scarcity or abundance may be a highly
    useful analytical tool.

    New Business for Old Europe : Product-Service Development,
    Competitiveness and Sustainability
*Authors:*

*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England : Routledge. 2006
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Selling products used to be the standard way of doing business.
    Traditionally, it is left to the user to transform the purchase of a
    product into something that fulfils effectively a final-user need.
    Today, two streams of research – business management and
    sustainability – normally with very distinct perspectives on the
    world, have surprisingly converged to form a common conclusion:
    selling products is old-fashioned business. Companies should switch
    their focus to selling need fulfilment, satisfaction, or
    experiences. Or, in other words, selling integrated solutions or
    product-services. The business management literature argues that, by
    focusing on the integrated, final-client needs, and delivering
    integrated solutions fulfilling these needs, companies will be able
    to improve their position in the value chain, enhance added value of
    their offering, and improve their innovation potential. In a
    business world where many products are becoming equally
    well-performing commodities, this strategy is one of the ways to
    avoid a sheer competition on price – a type of competition that
    Europe never can win with emerging and low-cost economies such as
    China. In that sense, product-services can mean new business for old
    Europe. The sustainability knowledge stream argues that need-focused
    solutions could be inherently more sustainable than products.
    Product-services could offer the value of use instead of the product
    itself and decrease the environmental load in two ways. First,
    companies offering the service would have all the incentives to make
    the (product-)system efficient, as they get paid by the result.
    Second, consumers would be encouraged to alter their behaviour as
    they gain insight into all the costs involved with the use. Until
    today, the connections and interchange between the two research
    streams have been quite limited. The question of whether
    product-services truly are the avenue to a sustainable world is
    still under discussion. This book aims to develop a systematic view
    on this issue. The potential of product-services to enhance
    competitiveness and contribute to sustainable development prompted
    the EU to invest heavily in the theme under the EU's 5th Framework
    Programme (FP5; 1997-2002). A variety of research and development
    projects in the field were supported under the umbrella of the
    Sustainable Product Development Network (SusProNet). These included
    MEPSS (Methodology Product Service Systems); Home Services; HiCS
    (Highly Customerised Solutions); Prosecco (Product-Service
    Co-design); and Innopse (Innovation Studio and exemplary
    developments for Product-Service). The projects were undertaken by a
    mix of European research institutions and companies including
    Orange, Philips and Nokia. Some of these projects focused on
    developing methods that could help industries change their output
    from a product to a service. Others focused on the development of
    new product-services or solutions (HiCS, Prosecco, Innopse), and yet
    others tried to analyze under which circumstances product-services
    are likely to be implemented and accepted by consumers (Home
    Services). One project focused on dissemination of the concept to
    SMEs (Lean Services). Other projects focused purely on new
    product-service development, such as Brainfridge (an intelligent
    fridge managing its supply chain), ASP-NET (application service
    providers), Protex (intelligent enzymes) and IPSCON (receivers for
    wireless telephones). New Business for Old Europe brings together
    the key outputs from all of these groups to present a
    state-of-the-art collection on product-service development,
    prospects and implications for competitiveness and sustainability.
    The book has a number of aims. First, it attempts to bridge the gap
    between business and sustainability literature to lead to a
    better-founded understanding of the business drivers for embarking
    on product-service development, and its relation with susta

    Stakeholder Politics : Social Capital, Sustainable Development, and
    the Corporation
*Authors:*
    Robert Boutilier
*Publication Information:*
    Stanford, California : Routledge. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The war is over. The largest corporations in the world are now
    committed to sustainability. But, behind the public relations gloss,
    corporate executives and managers are perplexed. The majority of
    them have a genuine desire to work in an ethical and sustainable
    manner. Yet, when they engage with their stakeholders for that
    purpose, they unexpectedly encounter a world of hardball politics
    full of hostile activists, self-interested elites and unpredictable
    attacks. Unfortunately, corporate management is too often unskilled
    in this rough-and-tumble world. While managers rely on facts and
    rational analysis, their self-appointed critics have mastered the
    arts of political discourse, issue framing and media manipulation.
    At the same time, as corporations extend their global reach, their
    third-world stakeholder communities are beset with a variety of
    poverty-maintaining and sustainability-thwarting conditions. In many
    parts of the world, communities suffer from entrenched divisions,
    exclusion from power, unpredictable violence and economic
    dependency. In order to both reduce reputational risk and to
    contribute to sustainable development, companies need the equivalent
    of roadmaps of the socio-political terrain in their stakeholder
    networks.This book moves on to next challenge of giving companies
    what they need now: namely,'how to'guides addressing the twin
    problems of firstly maintaining political legitimacy (talking the
    talk), and, secondly, promoting sustainable development (walking the
    walk). They need to learn how to both play stakeholder politics and
    collaborate with stakeholders towards sustainability goals. Most
    companies have already encountered or anticipated the barriers that
    this book addresses, and managers will recognize the dilemmas
    described.Stakeholder Politics is the first book to offer a method
    for classifying and dealing with these socio-political problems.The
    book presents a typology of stakeholder networks that will help
    managers and community leaders identify and improve the social
    capital patterns in their own networks. Once they know what patterns
    they have, they can move their networks towards those that foster
    sustainable community development. The author describes vivid cases
    in which managers and community stakeholders have already used the
    approach successfully. At the same time, managers get handy tools
    for predicting and avoiding community-level socio-political risk
    around stakeholder issues: most notably, the Stakeholder 360 which
    has been successfully used in Canada and Australia with large groups
    of managers learning about stakeholder engagement.The book has been
    written for an audience of both managers and academics. Those
    working in developing countries with difficult stakeholder issues
    will find it indispensable.

*Publication Information:*
    New York : Columbia University Press. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    From wood to coal to oil and gas, the sources of energy on which
    civilization depends have always changed as technology advances. Now
    renewables are overtaking fossil fuels, with wind and solar energy
    becoming cheaper and more competitive every year. Growth in
    renewable energy will further accelerate as electric vehicles become
    less expensive than traditional automobiles. Understanding the
    implications of the energy transition will prepare us for the many
    changes ahead.This book is a primer for readers of all levels on the
    coming energy transition and its global consequences. Bruce Usher
    provides a concise yet comprehensive explanation for the
    extraordinary growth in wind and solar energy; the trajectory of the
    transition from fossil fuels to renewables; and the implications for
    industries, countries, and the climate. Written in a straightforward
    style with easy-to-understand visual aids, the book illuminates the
    strengths and weaknesses of renewable energy based on business
    fundamentals and analysis of the economic forces that have given
    renewables a tailwind. Usher dissects the winners and losers,
    illustrating how governments and businesses with a far-sighted
    approach will reap long-term benefits while others will trail
    behind. Alongside the business and finance case for renewable
    energy, he provides a timely illustration of the threat of
    catastrophic climate change and the perils of delay. A short and
    powerful guide to our energy present and future, this book makes it
    clear that, from both economic and environmental perspectives, there
    is no time to lose.

    Bringing in the Future : Strategies for Farsightedness and

*Authors:*
    Ascher, William
*Publication Information:*
    Chicago : University of Chicago Press. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Humans are plagued by shortsighted thinking, preferring to put off
    work on complex, deep-seated, or difficult problems in favor of
    quick-fix solutions to immediate needs. When short-term thinking is
    applied to economic development, especially in fragile nations, the
    results corruption, waste, and faulty planning are often disastrous.
    In Bringing in the Future, William Ascher draws on the latest
    research from psychology, economics, institutional design, and legal
    theory to suggest strategies to overcome powerful obstacles to
    long-term planning in developing countries.Drawing on cases from
    Africa, Asia, and Latin America, Ascher applies strategies such as
    the creation and scheduling of tangible and intangible rewards,
    cognitive exercises to increase the understanding of longer-term
    consequences, self-restraint mechanisms to protect long-term
    commitments and enhance credibility, and restructuring policy-making
    processes to permit greater influence of long-term considerations.
    Featuring theoretically informed research findings and sound policy
    examples, this volume will assist policy makers, activists, and
    scholars seeking to understand how the vagaries of human behavior
    affect international development.

    The End of Automobile Dependence : How Cities Are Moving Beyond
    Car-Based Planning
*Authors:*
    Peter Newman
    Jeffrey Kenworthy
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, DC : Island Press. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Cities will continue to accommodate the automobile, but when cities
    are built around them, the quality of human and natural life
    declines. Current trends show great promise for future urban
    mobility systems that enable freedom and connection, but not
    dependence. We are experiencing the phenomenon of peak car use in
    many global cities at the same time that urban rail is thriving,
    central cities are revitalizing, and suburban sprawl is reversing.
    Walking and cycling are growing in many cities, along with
    ubiquitous bike sharing schemes, which have contributed to new
    investment and vitality in central cities including Melbourne,
    Seattle, Chicago, and New York. We are thus in a new era that has
    come much faster than global transportation experts Peter Newman and
    Jeffrey Kenworthy had predicted: the end of automobile dependence.
    In The End of Automobile Dependence, Newman and Kenworthy look at
    how we can accelerate a planning approach to designing urban
    environments that can function reliably and conveniently on
    alternative modes, with a refined and more civilized automobile
    playing a very much reduced and manageable role in urban
    transportation. The authors examine the rise and fall of automobile
    dependence using updated data on 44 global cities to better
    understand how to facilitate and guide cities to the most productive
    and sustainable outcomes. This is the final volume in a trilogy by
    Newman and Kenworthy on automobile dependence (Cities and Automobile
    Dependence in 1989 and Sustainability and Cities: Overcoming
    Automobile Dependence in 1999). Like all good trilogies this one
    shows the rise of an empire, in this case that of the automobile,
    the peak of its power, and the decline of that empire.

    London : Routledge. 2004
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainable development is capturing the attention of planners,
    politicians and business leaders. Within the academic sphere its
    study is increasingly breaching disciplinary boundaries to become a
    focus of attention for natural and social scientists alike. But in
    studying such a key concept, it is vital that there is a clear
    definition of what it means, how it is applied on the ground, and
    the influence it exerts upon people's perceptions of change in the
    physical environment, economic activity and society. Exploring
    Sustainable Development is a major new text which provides a
    multifaceted introduction to key areas of study in this field,
    examining sustainability at the full range of spatial scales from
    the local to the global. Building on existing theory it demonstrates
    the unique contributions that thinking geographically about space,
    place and human-environment relationships can bring to the analysis
    of sustainable development. This book explores different
    interpretations of sustainable development in both theory and
    practice, in developed and developing countries, and in rural and
    urban areas. It pays particular attention to the local, national and
    international politics of implementation, the future of climate and
    energy, the role of business, and different conceptions of
    agricultural sustainability. This wide-ranging text is ideal for
    undergraduates and postgraduates in geography, environmental
    science, development studies, and related social and political sciences.

    Tourism and Protected Areas in Brazil: Challenges and Perspectives

*Publication Information:*

*Description:*
    Tourism and Protected Areas in Brazil: Challenges and Perspectives
    intends to support research and management practices in the real
    world and build a capacity to strengthen connections between
    Brazilian society and its natural heritage. The chapters highlight
    public policy, planning and management issues to link theory and
    practical application of implementing tourism in protected areas.
    The book focuses on the analysis of social, environmental and
    managerial aspects that facilitate new approaches to tourism
    planning in protected areas. Upcoming challenges, such as
    public-private partnerships for tourism development, fewer resources
    from governments, and increasing visitor numbers are key topics in
    dealing with market demand to guarantee principles of sustainable
    tourism in Brazilian protected areas. Nature-based tourism remains a
    new area of knowledge in Brazil, with some papers published in
    regional and national journals. However, there is an increasing flux
    of tourists and a high demand to improve visitor experiences in
    these protected areas. Brazilian landscapes possess a myriad of
    nature-based tourism opportunities, indigenous cultures, and
    incredible biodiversity. Sustainability of these rely on research
    and support. This book is an insightful reference to how tourism
    challenges and opportunities are managed in Brazilian protected
    regions. The content and language are directed at undergraduate and
    graduate students, as well as tourism managers in these areas. Other
    beneficiaries of this publication include NGOs and students from
    tourism, environmental sciences, ecology, biology, sociology,
    economics, and interdisciplinary areas about protected areas within
    a developing country. This is a welcome reference for researchers
    worldwide, especially for studies on Brazilian nature-based tourism
    published in English are scarce. A number of new undergraduate,
    graduate and specialization courses focusing on nature tourism,
    ecotourism, sustainable development, and protected-area management
    have been created in the last decade in Brazil. Although
    international courses in developed countries focus on contributing
    to sustainable tourism and research in protected areas, there are
    few examples with a distinct focus on viable economic application
    and planning in Brazil. This book fills in a part of this gap. From
    the viewpoint of Brazilian researchers, it addresses the reality of
    the unique theoretical and practical issues facing these economies.
    It also discusses strategies in applications that focus on improving
    the benefits from tourism in these protected areas.

*Title:*
    Biophilic Cities : Integrating Nature Into Urban Design and Planning
*Authors:*
    Timothy Beatley
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, DC : Island Press. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Tim Beatley has long been a leader in advocating for the'greening'of
    cities. But too often, he notes, urban greening efforts focus on
    everything except nature, emphasizing such elements as public
    transit, renewable energy production, and energy efficient building
    systems. While these are important aspects of reimagining urban
    living, they are not enough, says Beatley. We must remember that
    human beings have an innate need to connect with the natural world
    (the biophilia hypothesis). And any vision of a sustainable urban
    future must place its focus squarely on nature, on the presence,
    conservation, and celebration of the actual green features and
    natural life forms. A biophilic city is more than simply a
    biodiverse city, says Beatley. It is a place that learns from nature
    and emulates natural systems, incorporates natural forms and images
    into its buildings and cityscapes, and designs and plans in
    conjunction with nature. A biophilic city cherishes the natural
    features that already exist but also works to restore and repair
    what has been lost or degraded. In Biophilic Cities Beatley not only
    outlines the essential elements of a biophilic city, but provides
    examples and stories about cities that have successfully integrated
    biophilic elements--from the building to the regional level--around
    the world. From urban ecological networks and connected systems of
    urban greenspace, to green rooftops and green walls and sidewalk
    gardens, Beatley reviews the emerging practice of biophilic urban
    design and planning, and tells many compelling stories of
    individuals and groups working hard to transform cities from grey
    and lifeless to green and biodiverse.

    World Sustainable Development Outlook 2007 : Knowledge Management
    and Sustainable Development in the 21st Century
*Authors:*
    Allam Ahmed
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2007
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The World Sustainable Development Outlook series has been developed
    to provide an overview of sustainable development, to discuss why it
    is important and to provoke forward thinking on the development of a
    more coherent approach to solving global problems related to
    sustainability through science and technology. In doing so, a
    holistic approach is used to critically examine the
    interrelationship between the natural, governmental, economic and
    social dimensions of our world and how science and technology can
    contribute to solutions. This is a truly global source book, which
    is reflected in the varied national and cultural origins of the
    contributors, as well as the topics and case studies covered. Each
    year a different theme will be covered. The theme of World
    Sustainable Development Outlook 2007 is the different dimensions of
    knowledge and technology management in the new era of information
    revolution and how they relate to sustainable development. Rapid
    innovation in information and communication technologies (ICTs) is
    clearly reshaping the world we live in. Countries are increasingly
    judged by whether they are information-rich or information-poor. It
    is estimated that 30–40% of the world's economic growth and 40–50%
    of all new jobs will be IT-driven. Education and knowledge are the
    chief currencies of the modern age, and can also be a strategic
    resource and a lifeline for sustainable development. Yet, in Africa,
    millions of people have never made a telephone call. The
    technological gulf between developed and developing countries (DCs)
    is likely to widen further with the rapid expansion of the internet
    and the speedy transition to digitalisation in the West. The impacts
    on DCs may include an increase in the so-called brain drain and
    growing dependence on foreign aid of a different kind – knowledge
    aid. There are fears that knowledge imperialism is already with us.
    What is clear is that most of the technological innovations in ICTs
    are Western-designed and fail to address the needs of the most
    disadvantaged. The interest of industrialised countries in the use
    of ICTs in DCs has largely been more concerned with the
    profitability of their own business enterprises than with any
    broader goals concerning the development of the host countries. DCs
    face the challenge of either becoming an integral part of the
    knowledge-based global economy or the very real danger of finding
    themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide. Successful
    management in the new millennium requires developing new methods and
    approaches to meet the challenges and opportunities of this
    information revolution while at the same time fostering sustainable
    development. Adopting a holistic approach, this book aims to
    critically examine the interrelationship between these different
    issues in order to reach solutions and a consensus for a better
    future, taking into account a variety of international,
    institutional and intellectual perspectives. It uses case and
    country studies in technological innovation and experience so that
    lessons in effective management of ICTs can be learned from
    successful initiatives, ideas and innovations.

    The New Rules of Green Marketing : Strategies, Tools, and
    Inspiration for Sustainable Branding
*Series:*
    BK Business Book
*Authors:*
    Jacquelyn Ottman
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield [England] : Routledge. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    For too long, marketers of sustainable goods and services have
    targeted'deep green'consumers to promote their products – and they
    have little to show for their efforts. In this innovative book,
    Jacquelyn Ottman shows how the green market has moved beyond such
    niche marketing, and how marketers will find greater success
    promoting the inherent superior value of their offerings. Greener
    products are now available within every industry and are a part of
    our everyday lives. But they didn't get to be so ubiquitous just
    because they are better for the planet. Whether they were promoted
    as such or not, sales of green products have grown so fast because
    of the added value they provide: health, superior performance, good
    taste, cost-effectiveness, or simply convenience. This central
    emphasis on primary benefits – the new rules – is critical to
    winning over the mainstream consumer and to driving overall
    organizational growth. The New Rules of Green Marketing helps
    readers understand why value-based sustainability marketing has
    become a critical organizational capacity, and how readers can adopt
    this approach in their own organizations. Illustrated by examples
    from both international mainstream and the more niche'deep
    green'leaders who are showing everyone else the way, the book
    provides practical strategies, tools and inspiration for building
    every aspect of a credible value-based green marketing strategy,
    including:How to use a proactive approach to sustainability to spur
    innovationHow to frame environment-related benefits with relevance
    to mainstream brandsHow to communicate with credibility and impact –
    and avoid'greenwashing'How to team up with stakeholders to maximize
    outreach to consumersHow to use a life cycle orientation to ensure
    the integrity of one's offeringsHow to best take advantage of recent
    technological advances in social mediaDrawing on the latest data
    from leading researchers and reflecting on learnings from Ottman's
    corporate clients and other pioneers including GE, Nike, HSBC,
    Method, Starbucks, Timberland, HP, NatureWorks, Philips, Procter &
    Gamble, Stonyfield Farm and Wal-Mart, this book shows how market
    leaders are edging out the competition using effective value-first
    marketing strategies. This book captures the best of the author's
    previous groundbreaking books on green marketing and takes the
    content into the 21st century. Whereas earlier works focused on
    readers who were less familiar with green initiatives, this work
    squarely focuses on a new generation of marketers who likely
    themselves grew up with an appreciation of sustainability and who
    want and need to know how to connect effectively with mainstream
    consumers.

*Resource Type:*

*Description:*
    Named a Notable Book for 2005 by the American Library Association,
    One with Nineveh is a fresh synthesis of the major issues of our
    time, now brought up to date with an afterword for the paperback
    edition. Through lucid explanations, telling anecdotes, and incisive
    analysis, the book spotlights the three elephants in our global
    living room-rising consumption, still-growing world population, and
    unchecked political and economic inequity-that together are
    increasingly shaping today's politics and humankind's future. One
    with Nineveh brilliantly puts today's political and environmental
    debates in a larger context and offers some bold proposals for
    improving our future prospect.

*Description:*
    There is a wealth of research and literature explaining suburban
    sprawl and the urgent need to retrofit suburbia. However, until now
    there has been no single guide that directly explains how to repair
    typical sprawl elements. The Sprawl Repair Manual demonstrates a
    step-by-step design process for the re-balancing and re-urbanization
    of suburbia into more sustainable, economical, energy- and
    resource-efficient patterns, from the region and the community to
    the block and the individual building. As Galina Tachieva asserts in
    this exceptionally useful book, sprawl repair will require a
    proactive and aggressive approach, focused on design, regulation and
    incentives. The Sprawl Repair Manual is a much-needed, single-volume
    reference for fixing sprawl, incorporating changes into the
    regulatory system, and implementing repairs through incentives and
    permitting strategies. This manual specifies the expertise that's
    needed and details the techniques and algorithms of sprawl repair
    within the context of reducing the financial and ecological
    footprint of urban growth. The Sprawl Repair Manual draws on more
    than two decades of practical experience in the field of repairing
    and building communities to analyze the current pattern of sprawl
    development, disassemble it into its elemental components, and
    present a process for transforming them into human-scale,
    sustainable elements. The techniques are illustrated both two- and
    three-dimensionally, providing users with clear methodologies for
    the sprawl repair interventions, some of which are radical, but all
    of which will produce positive results.

*Description:*
    In this compilation, the authors analyze how urban sustainability
    characteristics influence tourists when choosing a destination.
    Using a survey-based comparative analysis between Québec City and
    Bordeaux, we assess tourists'sensitivity to economic, environmental,
    social and cultural indicators of urban sustainability. The results
    suggest the relevance of using online and social media to improve
    tourists'awareness of the multidimensional nature of urban
    sustainability, while attracting younger and well-informed visitors.
    The formation of the working class in Catalonia bears a clear
    migratory imprint. In the second half of the 20th century migrant
    workers came from the south of Spain, and in the last 15 years they
    have come from non-European countries. This compilation aims to
    determine to what extent older migrants identify with newer migrants
    by comparing two Catalan working-class areas with a markedly
    different politics of memory, and showing how this affects
    possibilities of identification between old and new migrants. The
    next chapter proposes the Country Reputation Kaleidoscope Model
    (CRepK Model) as a theoretic-methodological framework using the case
    of Brazil, based on empirical evidences. The purpose of this
    cross-disciplinary research is to advance into the evolution of
    country reputation theory. The Scandinavian Bronze Age started quite
    rapidly in around 1750 BC, and is marked by three simultaneous
    events: importation of bronze from the east Mediterranean region,
    export of amber from southeast Sweden to the eastern Mediterranean
    region, and the carving of pictures of big ships on bedrock and
    boulders in southern Scandinavia. In this collection, the authors
    summarize and update available data, especially the data from
    southern Sweden. Following this, a study describes the short-term
    mapping of urban areas in Prague and its closest surroundings from
    1984 to 2017. Mapping was carried out using a number of Landsat
    images that employ spectral information from base bands and other
    information on vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI)
    and Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), and also land
    surface temperatures. Over the last few years, Tuscany has been
    strongly characterized by a number of economic events and operations
    where globalization has been one of the main drivers. Several local
    firms are attempting to survive in the global market, with the
    strategic plan to offer products and services that reinforce their
    specialization. They maintain a strong local identity with the
    history, tradition and local knowledge embedded in the Region while
    striving to gain an international relevance. The authors aim to
    address whether preserving the cultural heritage of the Tuscan
    Region as an outstanding resource for sustainable development could
    be the leading driver for the next future economic success. The
    authors go on to tell the story of the iconography of the Infant
    Jesus of Prague and the strong devotion that characterizes it and
    has changed the history of the city. In addition to the classical
    representation of the blessing Jesus, usually in the arms of the
    Virgin Mary and St. Joseph, there is that of the Infant Jesus of
    Prague, of which a strong devotion spread in Bohemia in 1600. The
    origin of this small, 45 cm-high wax statue and the name of the
    artist who created it is unknown. The closing article points out
    that the authors of the most comprehensive monographs on the
    prehistory of Cyprus almost completely ignored its northwestern
    part. However, this area, judging from the results of both earlier
    and recent research, cannot be considered terra inhabitata, since it
    was settled at least from the Late Neolithic period to the end of
    the Bronze Age. The authors suggest that these deficiencies mislead
    the potential reader, especially less familiar with archaeology of
    the island.

    unsustainable agriculture. Other cases explored are wildlife
    valuations, distributional effects of environmental policy, the
    emerging American nuclear power renaissance, regulation of care use,
    job losses with a raising GDP, cooperation between labour and
    environmentalists, plant biotechnology, participatory decision
    making, acoustic ecology, decent competition, and fractality as a
    key to global citizenship and ecological justice. The introduction
    sketches a framework for constructive evaluation of the
    interrelationships between environmental sustainability, economic
    sustainability, communities, and social interactions.

    The New Rules of Green Marketing : Strategies, Tools, and
    Inspiration for Sustainable Branding
*Authors:*
    Jacquelyn Ottman
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *1st ed. San Francisco, Calif : Berrett-Koehler Publishers. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Green products have been around since the 1970s, but it's only in
    recent years that they've become ubiquitous. That's because savvy
    green marketers are no longer targeting'deep green'consumers with
    a'save the planet'pitch. Instead, they're promoting the added value
    their products provide: better health, superior performance, good
    taste, or cost-effectiveness. In this innovative book Ottman argues
    that emphasizing primary benefits -- the New Rules -- is critical to
    winning over the mainstream consumer.Drawing on the latest poll data
    and incorporating lessons learned from her clients and other leading
    sustainable brands -- including GE, Nike, Method, Starbucks,
    Timberland, HP, NatureWorks, Procter & Gamble, Stonyfield Farm, and
    Wal-Mart -- Ottman provides practical strategies, tools, and
    inspiration for building every aspect of a credible value-based
    green marketing strategy. She covers such topics as spurring
    innovation through a proactive approach to sustainability,
    developing products that are green throughout their life cycle,
    communicating credibly to avoid accusations of'greenwashing,'teaming
    up with stakeholders to maximize outreach to consumers, taking
    advantage of social media, and much more.The New Rules of Green
    Marketing captures the best of Ottman's two previous groundbreaking
    books on green marketing and places it within a 21st Century
    context. Focusing on a new generation of marketers who likely grew
    up with an appreciation for sustainability, it provides in one place
    essential strategies, tools, and inspiration for connecting
    effectively with mainstream consumers.

    Smart Growth : From Sprawl to Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Jon Reeds
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *[North American edition]. Totnes, Devon : Green Books. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    People who live in compact, traditional towns have far smaller
    environmental footprints than those who live in sprawling suburbs.
    So why are we in thrall to urban sprawl? Are there better ways of
    getting about than by car? And how can 60 million people crammed
    into a small island find ways of treating it with respect?Urban
    sprawl is unsustainable in an age of climate change and peak oil.
    But for 100 years the UK's planning policies have been based on
    ideals of low-density living and attitudes that favour the
    individual over community, creating car-dependent lifestyles and
    destroying the countryside we love. This book explains what we must
    do to improve the quality of life in our overcrowded land.Smart
    Growth argues that we should look to America - a country that
    embraced urban sprawl and car dependency on a far grander scale than
    we ever did, and is now finding answers to the problem. Its ‘Smart
    Growth'movement is steering a course towards better-designed,
    compact cities and rail-based transit systems, thereby restoring
    communities ruined by decades of suburban insularity.

    The World Guide to CSR : A Country-by-Country Analysis of Corporate
    Sustainability and Responsibility
*Authors:*
    Wayne Visser
    Nick Tolhurst
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, U.K. : Routledge. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The World Guide to CSR is the first book to provide comparable
    national profiles that describe the evolution and practice of
    Corporate Sustainability and Responsibility (CSR) for 58 countries
    and 5 global regions. Each regional and national profile includes
    key information about the relevant CSR history, country-specific
    issues, trends, research and leading organizations. The purpose of
    the book is to give CSR professionals (including managers,
    consultants, academics and NGOs focusing on the social,
    environmental and ethical responsibilities of business) a quick
    reference guide to CSR in different regional and national contexts.
    The need for the book is premised on the fact that CSR professionals
    and researchers more often than not have a multinational remit and
    are required to benchmark performance internationally, but find that
    country-specific CSR information is ad hoc, limited or non-existent.
    Even where national CSR research exists, it is often hidden in
    academic journals that practitioners cannot access or do not have
    the time or inclination to read. The book is an edited volume, with
    expert contributors from around the world, all of whom have been
    screened and selected on the basis of their qualifications and
    experience in CSR. Each regional/country profile includes the
    following subsections:CSR in context Priority
    issues Trends Legislation and codes Organizations Case
    studies Educational institutions References This unique resource
    will be an essential acquisition for all organisations who need to
    benchmark their CSR strategies throughout different regions and
    cultures and want the best possible intelligence on the key issues
    and concerns relating to corporate social responsibility in all of
    the markets in which they operate.

    A Global Green New Deal : Rethinking the Economic Recovery
*Authors:*
    Edward B. Barbier
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge : Cambridge University Press. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Meeting the short run challenges of reviving the worldwide economy
    need not mean sacrificing long run economic and environmental
    sustainability. A Global Green New Deal (GGND) is an economic policy
    strategy for ensuring a more economically and environmentally
    sustainable world economic recovery. Reviving growth and creating
    jobs should be essential objectives. But policies should also aim to
    reduce carbon dependency, protect ecosystems and water resources,
    and alleviate poverty. Otherwise, economic recovery today will do
    little to avoid future economic and environmental crises. Part One
    argues why a GGND strategy is essential to the sustainability of the
    global economy. Part Two provides an overview of the key national
    policies whilst Part Three focuses on the global actions necessary
    to allow national policies to work. Part Four summarizes the main
    recommendations for national and international action, and discusses
    the wider implications for restructuring the world economy
    towards'greener'development.

    Environment and Society : Sustainability, Policy and the Citizen
*Series:*
    Ashgate Studies in Environmental Policy and Practice
*Authors:*
    Stewart Barr
*Publication Information:*
    Aldershot, England : Routledge. 2008
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Environment and Society explores ways to promote the behavioural
    shifts necessary for creating a'sustainable society'. Through a
    critical approach to the links between sustainability, policy and
    citizen engagement, the book argues that sustainability policy needs
    to move towards a positive perspective, utilizing the well-known
    techniques of segmentation and social marketing.
    Such'mainstreaming'of sustainable lifestyles is likely to be the
    only effective means of engaging the majority of citizens in the
    environmental debate, given the major influence of the consumer
    society on individual aspirations and beliefs. Comprised of three
    substantive elements, Environment and Society explores the context
    for behaviour change policy, the approaches adopted by politicians
    and academic researchers, and the application of such approaches
    using empirical data from two major research projects. The book is
    richly illustrated using both theoretical and empirical data and
    provides an excellent companion to all researchers interested in
    sustainable lifestyles.

*Description:*
    The pressure is on to enhance corporate reputations, achieve higher
    operational efficiency, improve planning and control, gain access to
    mineral resources, build trust with stakeholders, attract financing,
    recruit and retain a quality workforce, and lower costs. Sustainable
    Management of Mining Operations provides a holistic, practical
    approach to achieving these goals. The key, say the authors, is to
    create a culture within the organization that recognizes the value
    of sustainability by effectively integrating economic,
    environmental, and social considerations. Each section of this book
    focuses on sustainable management from a different perspective,
    management level, or stage of the mine life cycle. You'll benefit
    from real-life, practical insights from 27 internationally respected
    authors whose job titles have encompassed everything from CEO to
    master mechanic.

*Series:*
    State of the World
*Authors:*

*Publication Information:*
    New York, NY : Island Press. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    State of the World 2006 provides a special focus on China and India
    and their impact on the world as major consumers of resources and
    polluters of local and global ecosystems. The report explains the
    critical need for both countries to'leapfrog'the technologies,
    policies, and even the cultures that now prevail in many western
    countries for the sake of global sustainability—and reports on some
    of the strategies that China and India are starting to implement.
    Besides the focus on China and India, State of the World 2006 looks
    at actions corporations can take to be more socially responsible;
    examines the potential socioeconomic, health, and environmental
    implications of nanoscale technologies; assesses the impacts of
    large-scale development of biofuels on agriculture and the
    environment; describes mercury sources, industrial uses, and health
    hazards worldwide; and provides an overview of the need to safeguard
    freshwater ecosystems, with examples of proven approaches in cities,
    villages, and farming regions around the world.

    Building Sustainable Communities : Spatial Policy and Labour
    Mobility in Post-war Britain
*Authors:*
    Raco, Mike
*Publication Information:*
    Bristol, UK : Policy Press. 2007
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In 2003 the Labour Government published its ambitious Sustainable
    Communities Plan. It promised to bring about a'step change'in the
    English planning system and a new emphasis on the construction of
    more balanced, cohesive, and competitive places. This book uses
    historical and contemporary materials to document the ways in which
    policy-makers, in different eras, have sought to use state powers
    and regulations to create better, more balanced, and sustainable
    communities and citizens. It charts the changes that have take place
    in community-building policy frameworks, place imaginations, and
    core spatial policy initiatives in the UK since 1945. In so doing,
    it examines the tensions that have emerged within spatial policy
    over the types of places that should be created and the forms of
    mobility and fixity required to create them. It also shows that
    there are significant lessons that can be learnt from the
    experiences of the past. These can be used to inform contemporary
    policy debates over issues such as migration, uneven development,
    key worker housing, and sustainability. The book will be an
    important text for students and researchers in geography, urban
    studies, planning, and modern social history. It will also be of
    interest to practitioners working in central and local government,
    voluntary organisations, community groups, and those involved in the
    planning and design of sustainable communities.

    The Critical State of Corporate Social Responsibility in Europe
*Series:*
    Critical Studies on Corporate Responsibility, Governance and
    Sustainability, vol. 12
*Authors:*
    Ralph Tench
    Brian Jones
    William Sun
*Publication Information:*
    Bingley : Emerald Publishing Limited. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    European approaches to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) are
    supposed to be largely different from those in other continents like
    America, Asia, and Africa. Yet, European approaches to CSR are not a
    single and static one, but vary across and within national states
    and shift over time. This edited volume aims at exploring the
    uniqueness and complexity of European CSR approaches, perspectives,
    and practices through a critical lens. It contributes to existing
    understanding of European CSR by addressing the frontier CSR issues
    in the current state at the EU, national and institutional levels.
    Specifically, the volume critically examines the macro-level CSR
    frameworks, policies, and trends and their impact on CSR practices
    at the micro-level, including the roles of EU and national
    governments in shaping the CSR landscape in similar and different
    ways. It also analyses how various stakeholder groups and business
    sectors and firms across major European countries perceive,
    interpret and approach CSR in a dynamic way. Contributors of this
    book are experts mainly from Western and Eastern European countries
    and thus provide rich experiences, fresh insights, and deep
    understanding of the critical state of CSR in Europe.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainability is a new, important discourse aimed at promoting a
    new strategy in the development of energy, water and environmental
    (EWE) systems — the key components that affect the quality of life
    on our planet. It is becoming increasingly clear that the quest for
    sustainable development requires integrating economic, social,
    cultural, political and ecological factors. The behavior and
    properties of an EWE system arise not merely from the properties of
    its component elements, but also to a large degree also from the
    nature and intensity of their dynamic interlinkages. This volume
    helps clarify the complexity of these problems by providing a deeper
    understanding of the implications of the different aspects of
    sustainability.This work contains a collection of selected,
    peer-reviewed and state-of-the-art reflecting papers that were
    presented at the Third Dubrovnik Conference on Sustainable
    Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems that was held
    in June 5-10, 2005 in Dubrovnik, Croatia.

    Kate Theobald
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2005
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Urban governance and sustainability are rapidly becoming key issues
    around the world. Currently three billion people - half the
    population of the planet - live in cities, and by 2050 a full
    two-thirds of the world's population will be housed in ever larger
    and increasingly densely populated urban areas. The economic, social
    and environmental challenges posed by urbanization on such a large
    scale and at such a rapid pace are staggering for local, regional
    and national governments working towards sustainability. Solutions
    to the myriad problems plaguing the quest for sustainability at the
    city-level are equally as diverse and complex, but are rooted in the
    assumptions of the'sustainability agenda', developed at the Rio
    Earth Summit and embodied in Local Agenda/Action 21. These
    assumptions state that good governance is a necessary precondition
    for the achievement of sustainable development, particularly at the
    local level, and that the mobilization of local communities is an
    essential part of this process. Yet until now, these assumptions,
    which have guided the policies and programmes of over 6000 local
    authorities around the world, have never been seriously tested.
    Drawing on three years of field research in 40 European towns and
    cities, Governing for Sustainable Cities is the first book to
    examine empirically the processes of urban governance in sustainable
    development. Looking at a host of core issues including
    institutional and social capacity, institutional design, social
    equity, politics, partnerships and cooperation and creative
    policy-making, the authors draw compelling conclusions and offer
    strong guidance. This book is essential reading for policy-makers,
    politicians, activists and NGOs, planners, researchers and
    academics, whether in Europe, North America, Australasia or
    transitional and developing countries, concerned with advancing
    sustainability in our rapidly urbanizing world.

*Title:*
    Learning From the Global Financial Crisis : Creatively, Reliably,
    and Sustainably
*Series:*
    High Reliability and Crisis Management
*Authors:*
    Paul Shrivastava
    Matt Statler
*Publication Information:*
    Stanford, Calif : Stanford Business Books. 2012
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book is motivated by the simple hope that the cloud of the
    global financial crisis may yet have a silver lining—that political
    leaders, economists, and management scholars might seize this
    opportunity to reflect critically on the assumptions, practices, and
    infrastructures that have precipitated the crisis and to imagine and
    create new forms of organization that sustainably enhance the
    well-being of global stakeholders. The contributors suggest that
    aesthetic management, high reliability and crisis management, and
    sustainability science have much to contribute to the resolution of
    the collapse that we've witnessed, and to providing enduring lessons
    for how to structure the institutions of the future. Learning From
    the Global Financial Crisis devotes a section to each of these
    areas, offering full-length chapters which explore key issues in
    depth, as well as shorter commentaries that focus on practical
    considerations. The chapters progress from micro-level issues that
    pertain to individuals and teams who act creatively; to the
    meso-level issues that pertain to the structures, practices, and
    processes; to the macro-level issues that pertain to the
    interdependent, ecological systems. Together, the contributions
    emphasize the importance of developing holistic responses to the
    financial crisis. The result is a volume that casts new light on
    traditional economic and managerial theories and policies and
    provides fresh ideas to a new generation of scholars and practitioners.

    The Business of Sustainable Mobility : From Vision to Reality
*Authors:*
    Paul Nieuwenhuis
    Philip Vergragt
    Peter Wells
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2006
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In many parts of the world, there is a crisis of mobility. The
    choices we have made over the past 200 years on modes and
    technologies of transport have brought us unprecedented global
    interaction and in many respects increased personal freedom.
    However, all this mobility has come at a cost to society, to the
    economy and to the environment. Mobility is in crisis, but few seem
    aware of the full extent of it. Though most people will be aware of
    congestion, accidents (although this aspect is often overlooked),
    parking restrictions or fuel prices, few will have considered the
    effects of the dramatic increase in mobility expected in China,
    India and elsewhere. Nor do many people in their daily lives
    consider the impact of climate change on our environment and the
    contribution our cars make to it. It is often thought that
    technology alone can solve this problem. For some observers,
    salvation could be achieved by means of hydrogen fuel cells, by
    hybrid cars, or by increased fuel efficiency, or even by telematics
    to reduce congestion. This book shows that'technology'may well not
    be enough in itself and that for a genuinely sustainable transport
    future far more radical change – affecting many aspects of society –
    is needed. It is likely, for example, that new business models are
    needed, as well as users and consumers adopting new forms of
    behaviour. Disruptive technological innovation may well contribute,
    but needs to be induced by a combination of market forces and
    government regulation.Many studies touch on transport and mobility
    issues and more mainstream books aimed at challenging the dominance
    of automobility are common, yet works dealing with the longer-term
    strategic, theoretical and broader conceptual issues needed to
    inform the move towards more sustainable transport are rare. Yet
    policy-makers, practitioners, as well as many sections of academia,
    acknowledge a need for guidance on new thinking on sustainable
    mobility. This book brings together a range of views representing
    both leading-edge thinking and best practice in the mobility sector.
    The individual expert contributions form the basis for framing a
    broader vision of future mobility and proposed transition
    trajectories towards that future.Much of the effort reflected in the
    chapters in this book is concerned with going beyond
    the'technofix'of new cars, to confront the more difficult challenges
    of institutional, cultural and social change within and beyond the
    industry that have to be resolved in the transition towards
    sustainability. It therefore seeks to break through the conventional
    boundary between engineering and the social sciences, and the
    contributors come from both sides of this traditional but
    unnecessary divide, combining economists, engineers, geographers,
    designers and others.The work is based on the sustainable mobility
    stream in the 2003 International Greening of Industry Network
    conference in San Francisco. This event brought together experts
    from industry and government, and the book combines some of the
    papers presented there, developed and updated into full chapters,
    with a number of additional chapters to capture some of the themes
    that emerged from the conference.The central problem addressed in
    this book is the private car: how to power it, how to build it and
    how to deliver it to customers in a more sustainable future. It
    starts with ideas of radical innovation in the propulsion system of
    the car, notably the hydrogen fuel cell. In one section, the book
    examines business models that could be used to deliver automobility
    in a more sustainable manner. This section looks at how the car is
    made and used, and looks beyond it by examining how we could change
    those aspects in our quest for sustainable mobility. The book then
    considers a number of recently introduced vehicles and alternative
    vehicle concepts within the context of a dominant existing paradigm.
    These vary from a minimalist single-seat commuter to a powertrain
    exchange concept that could b

*Authors:*
    Paul Sillitoe
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. New York : Berghahn Books. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    With growing evidence of unsustainable use of the world's resources,
    such as hydrocarbon reserves, and related environmental pollution,
    as in alarming climate change predictions, sustainable development
    is arguably the prominent issue of the 21st century. This volume
    gives a wide ranging introduction focusing on the arid Gulf region,
    where the challenges of sustainable development are starkly evident.
    The Gulf relies on non-renewable oil and gas exports to supply the
    world's insatiable CO2 emitting energy demands, and has built
    unsustainable conurbations with water supplies dependent on energy
    hungry desalination plants and deep aquifers pumped beyond natural
    replenishment rates. Sustainable Development has an
    interdisciplinary focus, bringing together university faculty and
    government personnel from the Gulf, Europe, and North America --
    including social and natural scientists, environmentalists and
    economists, architects and planners -- to discuss topics such as
    sustainable natural resource use and urbanization, industrial and
    technological development, economy and politics, history and geography.

*Publication Information:*

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    China is an energy-dependent country and its rapid economic growth
    in the past 30 years is accompanied by tremendous energy
    consumption. Constrained by resource endowment, most of the primary
    energy consumed in China is coal, which leads to serious global,
    regional and local environmental issues. To ensure sustainable
    development, China has formulated ambitious targets for developing
    renewable energy and dozens of policies to deliver it have been
    adopted. Especially since the enactment of the Renewable Energy Law
    in 2006, renewable energy has experienced a boom in China. Now China
    is the biggest developer of hydropower and wind power, as well as
    the biggest manufacturer of PV cells in the world. This book is a
    systematic review on renewable energy in China and focuses on four
    interrelated topics: resources, institution, policy and industry
    development. The introductory chapter will describe the overall
    picture of renewable energy in China. Then four industries,
    including wind power, solar power, biomass and ocean power, will be
    discussed in separate chapters around the policy, industry
    development, barriers and market prospective. In light of the
    important role in delivering renewable energy, the next chapter
    discusses the progress of smart grids in China, with a particular
    perspective on the institutional arrangement for promoting its
    development more effectively. A chapter is devoted to the progress
    of Golden Sun Program, the Chinese government's initiative to
    promote the domestic solar power market. Another chapter addresses
    rural energy, poverty and renewable energy, a special topic on
    social and developmental aspects of renewable energy. The last
    chapter presents the topic of energy systems in transition and
    proposes policy suggestions for delivering renewable energy in China.

*Publication Information:*
    Collingwood, Vic : CSIRO PUBLISHING. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Southern Australia is one of the three most fire-prone areas on
    Earth. After more than a century of urban growth and valiant efforts
    to ‘tame'the bush, recent decades have seen more people moving back
    onto the fringe or into the middle of this volatile landscape. As
    this movement has intensified, so has the debate on how to best
    protect life and property from the ever-present bushfire threat. A
    long-running drought and a predicted warming climate have ensured
    that bushfire is a dominant factor in our nation's long-term
    planning. Following the tragic Victorian Black Saturday fires in
    2009, a much greater urgency now confronts policy makers, land and
    fire managers and communities living in bushfire areas. This has led
    to a call for a single, simple answer on fuel reduction burning to
    reduce the bushfire risk. Burning Issues explains that this is a
    complex issue without such a simple answer. The book gives an
    account of the role of fire in Australia's ecosystems, how we have
    to accept and live with fire, and how we can manage fire both for
    safety and for diversity. It aims to change people's attitudes to
    fire, and to be influential in encouraging changes in land
    management by government agencies.

    Making Healthy Places : Designing and Building for Health,

    Richard J. Jackson
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C. : Island Press. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The environment that we construct affects both humans and our
    natural world in myriad ways. There is a pressing need to create
    healthy places and to reduce the health threats inherent in places
    already built. However, there has been little awareness of the
    adverse effects of what we have constructed-or the positive benefits
    of well designed built environments. This book provides a
    far-reaching follow-up to the pathbreaking Urban Sprawl and Public
    Health, published in 2004. That book sparked a range of inquiries
    into the connections between constructed environments, particularly
    cities and suburbs, and the health of residents, especially humans.
    Since then, numerous studies have extended and refined the book's
    research and reporting. Making Healthy Places offers a fresh and
    comprehensive look at this vital subject today. There is no other
    book with the depth, breadth, vision, and accessibility that this
    book offers. In addition to being of particular interest to
    undergraduate and graduate students in public health and urban
    planning, it will be essential reading for public health officials,
    planners, architects, landscape architects, environmentalists, and
    all those who care about the design of their communities. Like a
    well-trained doctor, Making Healthy Places presents a diagnosis
    of--and offers treatment for--problems related to the built
    environment. Drawing on the latest scientific evidence, with
    contributions from experts in a range of fields, it imparts a wealth
    of practical information, with an emphasis on demonstrated and
    promising solutions to commonly occurring problems.

*Authors:*
    M. Paloma Pavel
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge, MA : The MIT Press. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Activists, analysts, and practitioners describe innovative
    strategies that promote healthy neighborhoods, fair housing, and
    accessible transportation throughout America's cities and
    suburbs.The emerging metropolitan regional-equity movement promotes
    innovative policies to ensure that all communities in a metropolitan
    region share resources and opportunities equally. Too often,
    low-income communities and communities of color bear a
    disproportionate burden of pollution and lack access to basic
    infrastructure and job opportunities. The metropolitan
    regional-equity movement—sometimes referred to as a new civil rights
    movement—works for solutions to these problems that take into
    account entire metropolitan regions: the inner-city core, the
    suburbs, and exurban areas. This book describes current efforts to
    create sustainable communities with attention to the “triple bottom
    line”—economy, environment, and equity—and argues that these three
    interests are mutually reinforcing.After placing the movement in its
    historical, racial, and class context, Breakthrough Communities
    offers case studies in which activists'accounts alternate with
    policy analyses. These describe efforts in Detroit, New York City,
    San Francisco, Atlanta, Camden, Chicago, Los Angeles, and other
    metropolitan areas to address such problems as vacant property,
    brownfields, affordable housing, accessible transportation,

*Description:*
    Congress has an ongoing interest in ensuring that the 500,000
    buildings and other structures owned and operated by the Department
    of Defense (DOD) are operated effectively in terms of cost and
    resource use. Section 2830 of the National Defense Authorization Act
    for fiscal year requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report
    to the congressional defense committees on the energy-efficiency and
    sustainability standards used by DOD for military construction and
    major renovations of buildings. DOD's report must include a
    cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, and long-term payback
    for the building standards and green building certification systems,
    including: (A) American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and
    Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 189.1-2011 for the
    Design of High-Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise
    Residential. (B) ASHRAE Energy Standard 90.1-2010 for Buildings
    Except Low-Rise Residential. (C) Leadership in Energy and
    Environmental Design (LEED) Silver, Gold, and Platinum certification
    for green buildings, as well as the LEED Volume certification. (D)
    Other American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited
    standards. DOD's report to the congressional defense committees must
    also include a copy of DOD policy prescribing a comprehensive
    strategy for the pursuit of design and building standards across the
    department that include specific energy-efficiency standards and
    sustainable design attributes for military construction based on the
    cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, and demonstrated
    payback required for the aforementioned building standards and green
    building certification systems. Energy-Efficiency Standards and
    Green Building Certification Systems Used by the Department of
    Defense for Military Construction and Major Renovations summarizes
    the recommendations for energy efficiency.

    Earth in Our Care : Ecology, Economy, and Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Maser, Chris
*Publication Information:*
    New Brunswick, N.J. : Rutgers University Press. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    'What about the twenty-first century? Will we finally accept our
    responsibilities as guardians of planet Earth, the biological living
    trust, for the beneficiaries, the children of today, tomorrow, and
    beyond? Or, will it too be a century of lethal, economic struggle
    among the polarized positions of the supremely dysfunctional among
    us? Are they—once again—to be allowed to determine the legacy we, as
    a society, as a nation, bequeath those who follow us? The choice is
    ours, the adults of the world. How shall we choose?'So writes Chris
    Maser in this compelling study of three interactive spheres of the
    ecosystem: atmosphere (air), litho-hydrosphere (rock that comprises
    the restless continents and the water that surrounds them), and
    biosphere (all life sandwiched in between).Rich in detail and
    insightful analogies, Earth in Our Care addresses key issues
    including land-use policies, ecological restoration, forest
    management, local living, and sustainability thinking. Exploring our
    interconnectedness with the Earth, Maser examines today's problems
    and, more importantly, provides solutions for the future.

    Sustainable Banking : The Greening of Finance
*Authors:*
    Jan Jaap Bouma
    Marcel Jeucken
    Leon Klinkers
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, U.K. : Routledge. 2001
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This comprehensive addition to the debate on sustainable development
    has been produced in order to take a global pulse on how the
    financial services sector is responding to the growing challenge of
    shareholder and stakeholder expectations on social and environmental
    performance. In the opinion of many commentators in this new book,
    given the intermediary role banks play within economies, their
    potential contribution toward sustainable development is enormous.
    Indeed, for banks, the conclusion that corporate sustainability has
    become an investable concept that increases long-term shareholder
    value is becoming difficult to deny.To date, banks have been
    relatively slow to examine their exposure to risk (the environmental
    and social performance of their clients) and the business
    opportunities of sustainable development (the products and services
    they offer). Not before time, Sustainable Banking concludes that
    this is beginning to change, with both risk and opportunity becoming
    established elements in banking policies towards environmental
    sustainability. In addition, banks have now begun to take notice of
    and address their own environmental performance. Through the use of
    case studies and detailed analysis, the book examines the
    environmental policies of banks, the importance of transparency and
    communication with their stakeholders, environmental and ethical
    investment funds, current practice by the providers of financial
    services with regard to environmental risk management and, finally,
    the key role of government, NGOs and multilateral banks in
    delivering sustainability.Sustainable banking has not, however, been
    achieved and nor will it be in the immediate future. As
    globalisation proceeds apace, Sustainable Banking argues that
    improvements are necessary in banks'attitudes toward transparency
    and accountability with regard to their lending policies. In
    addition, in order to promote best practice, the leading banks need
    to start measuring their customers'environmental performance in
    order to persuade polluting clients that minimum compliance to
    regulations will no longer suffice. The book finds many shining
    examples in the co-operative, mutual and social sectors for the big
    players to emulate. Environmental and ethical considerations in such
    loan portfolios have proven to be profitable
    and'best-in-class'larger banks are now also reaping benefits.The
    unprecedented scope of the book has attracted contributors from four
    continents including Deloitte & Touche, Rabobank, The World Bank,
    The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, The United
    Nations Environment Programme, The World Business Council for
    Sustainable Development, UBS, Henderson Investors, KPMG, The World
    Resources Institute and SAM Sustainability.

    Corporate Social Responsibility In China: A Vision, An Assessment

*Authors:*
    Benoit Vermander
*Publication Information:*
    Hackensack, NJ : World Scientific. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Over the years, many corporations have been trying to determine what
    they can and should do to contribute to the sustainability of the
    economic, social and ecological environment within which they
    operate. Corporate social responsibility has become a key senior
    management issue worldwide and an increasingly debated topic in
    China. This book aims at helping companies operating in China to
    better assess and exercise their corporate social responsibility
    (CSR) in specific contexts. The purpose of this book is to show that
    CSR has a strong economic pay back in the long run, that it is a key
    success factor in nurturing corporate excellence, and that a sense
    of urgency and accrued inventiveness are required from companies
    operating in China.Cross-disciplinary in scope, the book aims at
    helping students and analysts in political science, governance,
    international relations and Chinese studies to understand and
    appreciate the unique role that firms play in shaping a new China.
    It focuses on the relationship between the state, civil society and
    corporations in the Chinese context. It researches the conditions
    under which this relationship might result in redefining China's
    developmental model.This practical, business-oriented book takes
    into account China's classical and contemporary thought on CSR. It
    is the result of a long research and collaborative process with
    several institutions and industry leaders.Contents:CSR in the
    Chinese Context: A Vision:What is CSR?The Legal, Professional and

*Description:*
    This report summarizes a workshop organized by the National
    Academies'Roundtable on Science and Technology for Sustainability.
    The workshop brought together a select group of program managers
    from the public and private sectors to discuss specific cases of
    linking knowledge to action in a diverse set of integrated
    observation, assessment, and decision support systems. Workshop
    discussions explored a wide variety of experiments in harnessing
    science and technology to goals of promoting development and
    conserving the environment. Participants reflected on the most
    significant challenges that they have faced when trying to implement
    their programs and the strategies that they have used to address
    them successfully. The report summarizes discussions at the
    workshop, including common themes about the process of linking
    knowledge with actions for sustainable development that emerged
    across a wide range of cases, sectors, and regions.

*Description:*
    Sustainability Strategies for Industry contains essays by members of
    the Greening of Industry Network that examine the emerging picture
    of sustainability and its implications for industry and for the
    relationship between industry and other social actors -- consumers,
    employees, and the community at large. The book seeks to define
    sustainability in an industrial context, and addresses how the shift
    to sustainaibility will affect the role of industry in society, its
    managerial functions, and its relationships with stakeholders and
    the environment.An introductory chapter establishes the scope of the
    book and its contents, sets out the historical context, and explores
    the unifying concepts and themes running through the text. Chapters
    examine.the meaning of sustainability for industry from a
    theoretical stance corporate environmentalism company paradigms
    technology reporting and management systems the role of networks and
    systems developing country perspectives implications for business
    research and management educatio.Contributors -- including Thomas
    Gladwin, Richard Welford, Andrew Hoffman, John Ehrenfeld, and David
    Pearce -- offer a bold vision of the sustainable industrial
    organization of the future and the role and approach that managers
    in sustainable organizations will assume.Sustainability Strategies
    for Industry represents an important work for those interested in
    the relationship between sustainability and environmental management
    and protection, and for those interested in the future direction of
    industrial organization. It will be a valuable text for advanced
    undergraduate and graduate students in business and economics, as

    Corporate Strategy in the Age of Responsibility
*Authors:*
    Peter McManners
*Publication Information:*
    Farnham, Surrey, England : Routledge. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    As the era of ever expanding markets and ample resources ends,
    governments and business will have to behave differently. The world
    is facing weak economic growth, limits to affordable resources and
    increasing concerns about environmental consequences. During the
    boom times, governments championed de-regulation and business
    responded by adopting an anything-goes attitude. In these straitened
    times, strategic analysis has to engage with the challenges that
    society faces to create resilient corporations fit for the 21st
    century. In Corporate Strategy in the Age of Responsibility, Peter
    McManners, who has for nine years run strategy workshops on the
    Henley MBA focusing on the global business environment, sets about
    providing a strategic framework for navigating the new economic
    environment. Chief Sustainability Officers (CSOs) now exist, but
    they struggle to find the strategic rationale for the improvements
    they champion. The author argues that their good intentions often
    lack traction, partly because others in management don't get it, but
    also because they are not ambitious enough. The book is not about
    preaching semi-charitable behaviour or how to enhance the reputation
    of the corporation instead it is about surviving and thriving in a
    challenging and changing environment. A corporate audience familiar
    with strategy books will relate to this book, but will find it
    steers them towards radically new strategic thinking suitable for a
    turbulent period of transition.

*Resource Type:*

*Description:*
    The concept of sustainable development refers to doing what is
    necessary to try and guarantee that future generations will also be
    able to satisfy their needs. Taking this idea as a reference, the
    different areas of public administration, the business world and
    society as a whole are trying to spread the idea of respect for our
    natural resources as widely as possible. This book analyzes the
    importance of sustainable development in optimizing our future,
    discussing and proposing new paradigms, procedures and techniques
    addressed on the one hand to improving lifestyles, well-being or
    quality of life, and sustainable business practices, among other
    things, and on the other to preserving natural resources and ecosystems.

    Education Policy As a Roadmap for Achieving the Sustainable

*Authors:*
    Alison Taysum
*Publication Information:*
    Bingley : Emerald Publishing Limited. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have been agreed
    globally as an unprecedented, ambitious and innovative agenda for
    prosperity and peace for people and the planet. Currently
    researchers, policymakers and nations are trying to identify clear
    routes for achieving these ambitious goals by 2030. This timely text
    examines how education policy provides a roadmap to achieving
    Sustainable Development Goal 4, achieving inclusive and equitable
    quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for
    all. Taysum situates the SDGs, and the roadmap to achieving them,
    within a historical framework of established philosophy by drawing
    upon the ideas of the social contract, moral values and universal
    principles. As well as offering a theoretical understanding of these
    concepts, this research also offers practical solutions by
    demonstrating how university Vice Chancellors, Deans of Faculties
    and Schools of Education can work in partnership with the wider
    community in order to achieve the SDGs. Supported by a website and
    rich bank of practical resources, this book will prove invaluable
    for education leaders and those in the fields of higher education
    and moral philosophy.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book discusses how citizens can participate more effectively in
    sustainability science and environmental policy debates. It
    discusses designs for participatory procedures, and experiences of
    their application to issues of global change. While the focus is on
    citizen participation, the involvement of specific stakeholders -
    including water managers and venture capitalists - is also
    addressed. The book describes how focus group methods were combined
    with the interactive use of computer models into new forms of
    participation, tested with six hundred citizens. The results are
    discussed in relation to other important topics, including
    greenhouse gas and water management. By combining this with an
    examination of issues of interactive governance and developing
    country participation, the book provides state-of-the-art, practical
    insights for students, researchers and policy makers alike.

*Publication Information:*
    Farnham, England : Routledge. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainability is normally considered to be about choices for the
    future being limited by decisions made in the present, and is
    frequently portrayed as concerning environmental issues alone. The
    Durable Corporation rejects both of these notions to argue that
    sustainability is a more complex concept that involves balancing
    many factors. It explores the nature, value and role of
    sustainability in business and maintains that resource utilization
    must be based upon the twin pillars of equity and efficiency rather
    than attempting to ensure that our choices in the future are not
    reduced. The authors of The Durable Corporation propose a new model
    of sustainability and a fresh approach to managing resources. They
    extend this to the development of difference strategies for
    achieving sustainability and an alternative approach to managing for
    the future. These features make it essential reading for all those
    with responsibility for the sustainability or durability of the
    enterprises in which they are engaged or in the study of the issues
    at stake.

*Description:*
    'What Mr. Laszlo calls'Planetary Ethics'or the integration of
    economic, environmental, social and high ethical objectives into
    long-term business strategy, is the new price of entry for corporate
    survival. Those who'get'this and do it best will enjoy increasing

    FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY WORLDWIDE, THE PROCTER
    & GAMBLE COMPANY Corporate governance and sustainability are moving
    from important peripheral problems to core business concerns, as
    winning companies discover stakeholders as new sources of value. Yet
    there are many obstacles to bringing these issues into the
    mainstream of business. Concepts like sustainable development can be
    confusing for operating managers, and even those who support the
    underlying issues find it difficult to frame them in ways that are
    useful for making business decisions. As a manager you have a
    responsibility to deliver financial returns to your shareholders:
    how can you balance this obligation with your responsibilities to
    society and the environment? The Sustainable Company articulates an
    innovative approach to meeting this challenge in a language familiar

    North America in the Anthropocene

    [RMB Manifesto Series]
*Authors:*
    Sandford, Robert W.
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. [Victoria, British Columbia] : RMB | Rocky
    Mountain Books. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Robert William Sandford's latest RMB manifesto invites the reader to
    separate the hype from the hope with respect to the outcomes of the
    2015 Paris climate conference and in relation to humanity's
    dangerous new era — the Anthropocene. In responding to the urgency –
    and the opportunity – of getting sustainable development right, the
    United Nations engaged in numerous program announcements and
    international conversations during the final months of 2015. Most
    notable were the Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP21) in
    Paris and the long anticipated launch of Transforming our World: The
    2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Among the many other
    indicators of quickening public awareness of climate issues, these
    two illustrate that sustainability and climate change are two sides
    of the same coin: in order to make any headway on the one, we must
    also deal with the other. Both affect all of humanity, and North
    America is something of a test case. North America in the
    Anthropocene maintains that human beings have entered a new
    historical epoch – the Anthropocene – in which our own economic
    activity has reached such planetary scale and power that we can no
    longer count on Earth's natural systems and functions to absorb
    negative human impacts on landscape and biodiversity. Whether we
    like it or not, we have to assume responsibility for staying within
    Earth-system boundaries. Climate stability is only one of those
    boundaries, but it is a critical one. This book attempts to address
    the question of why, when we clearly know the enormous risks we
    face, we are still not doing what is necessary to prevent climate
    disaster. The author introduces contemporary thinking by leading
    philosophers, ethicists and social scientists who do not believe
    that more information and greater individual thoughtfulness are
    necessarily going to be adequate to penetrate the thick skin of the
    status quo when it comes to addressing the climate threat. Rather,
    we need to better understand human nature and organizational
    inclinations and squarely face habits of collective thought that are
    holding us back from action. We also need to be frank about the ways
    in which disaster provides opportunity for rapid change in
    established public mindsets. The central tenet of this book is that
    what we as a society are facing is nothing less than a struggle to
    redefine our entire dominant mythology. If we want to survive and
    prosper in the Anthropocene, we will have to invent – and
    continuously reinvent – a new human mythos. Given the enormous
    challenges we face, creating that new mythos should be our society's
    most urgent common enterprise.

    Mindful Communication for Sustainable Development : Perspectives

*Authors:*
    Kalinga Seneviratne
*Publication Information:*

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Written by Asian scholars, Mindful Communication for Sustainable
    Development: Perspectives from Asia analyzes Asian philosophical
    ideas and communication theories that promote respect for cultural
    diversity, protection of environment, and ‘sufficiency
    economic'models. It discusses how ancient Asian teachings,
    particularly from the Buddhist, Hindu, and Confucius schools of
    thought, can enrich modern-day communication needs and help to
    achieve the Sustainable Development Goals espoused by the United
    Nations. As a mindful communication revolution spreads across the
    world, especially in the West, this book draws attention to the
    danger of practicing mindfulness without its spiritual and ethical
    leanings. The book puts forward innovative ideas on applying
    traditional practices to modern digital communication. It rethinks
    development communication methods and how the media reports on
    economic, environmental, and developmental issues. It promotes a new
    paradigm of communication, one that is centered on both social
    harmony and freedom of expression. It is an essential read for
    development communicators and trainers.

    The Global Carbon Crisis : Emerging Carbon Constraints and Strategic
    Management Options
*Authors:*
    Busch, Timo
    Shrivastava, Paul
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    For at least a decade the science of climate change has warned us of
    the dire need for action – particularly by corporations who are the
    main engines of economic production and consumption. Yet managerial
    and corporate understanding of climate change and related energy
    issues remains fragmented and present actions lack the urgency this
    critical problem deserves. There is a whole new economy – the
    low-carbon economy – looming on the horizon. But our consumption and
    production patterns remain in a carbon-locked position. What we are
    risking is a global carbon crisis and a case of history repeating.
    Humankind's failure to adequately recognise the onset of and address
    the effects of the global financial crisis mirrors our similar
    failures with the carbon crisis. There are many parallels: both are
    and were predictable and both will have direct implications on
    humanity on a sweeping, indiscriminate and severe scale. The
    difference is that we cannot reverse the effects of climate change
    and fossil fuel scarcity as easily as we can repair the global
    financial system. It is of paramount importance that we wake up to
    the risks and begin tackling the issues early enough. To
    successfully address the risks, business needs to be aware of the
    consequences that a changing climate and finite carbon resources
    will have on their business performance. The element carbon – both
    as a resource and as an emission – is both an economic threat as
    well as an opportunity for companies. It is a threat for
    carbon-intense production systems that will need to be changed to
    avoid further harmful climatic change, and take into account the
    limited availability of carbon-based fuels. At the same time, new
    opportunities will emerge for companies who can creatively design
    and produce goods and services that fit the new emerging
    carbon-constrained business environment. Many sectors of the economy
    – for example, renewable energy, energy and resources conservation,
    waste reduction and management, carbon finance markets – will expand
    rapidly, as other carbon- and resource-intensive sectors decline.
    The Global Carbon Crisis succinctly translates important insights
    from the natural sciences, economics and equity discussions, for the
    business reader. It reviews important aspects of these discussions
    and clarifies misunderstandings with respect to climate change and
    fossil fuel availability and their implications for business. The
    book provides simple, direct, pragmatic and effective solutions that
    policy-makers and corporate managers can implement. The aim is to
    provoke action – thoughtful action – towards developing a low-carbon
    future for companies on three levels. At the macro level, the
    authors discuss the importance of tough industrial policies for
    climate change and propose the idea of an international carbon-equal
    fund. At the meso level, they elaborate on the role of inter-firm
    collaborations for establishing low-carbon industries and production
    systems. At the micro level, they illustrate the virtue of proactive
    carbon strategies and suggest a corporate carbon management
    framework. Getting the message of the carbon crisis across to a
    business audience has proved challenging. This book successfully
    makes the case that they are intricately connected to one another
    and practising managers and business students will benefit from
    viewing the carbon crisis in parallel to the financial meltdown. The
    book will be essential reading for all businesses grappling with
    carbon-related issues and for many in academia, including those in
    management, strategy, finance, corporate social responsibility and
    sustainable development, globalisation and innovation studies.

    Ecological Economics of Sustainable Watershed Management
*Series:*
    Advances in the Economics of Environmental Resources, v. 7
*Authors:*
    Jon D. Erickson
    Frank Messner
    Irene Ring
*Publication Information:*
    Amsterdam : JAI Press Inc. 2007
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The papers in this volume illustrate the power of a scientific
    approach to ecological economics. Good science is a careful blend of
    theory and empirical testing. Theory without empirical grounding is
    of no practical value and random case studies without a theoretical
    context are not generalizable. The back and forth interplay between
    theory and evidence is apparent in the modeling exercises,
    evaluation studies, and policy design described in this book.
    Watershed management has been chosen as a concrete focus to
    illuminate the facets of sustainability. It requires both a deep
    understanding of the natural processes in watersheds and of the
    societal processes which strongly depend on the natural watershed
    services. Furthermore, country-specific governance structures need
    to be considered to fine-tune the design of sustainable watershed
    policies in order to approach an interaction of society and nature,
    which ensures a long term use of water resources without adverse
    effects on society and the environment. This book has accepted the
    challenge to tackle the complex scientific underpinning of
    sustainable watershed analysis and management and will reveal basic
    ecological economic knowledge and methodological approaches in this
    prominent field of research.

*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Bingley, UK : Emerald Publishing Limited. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Faced with dwindling resources and the challenge of climate change,
    companies are seeking to enhance production while consuming fewer
    resources. At the same time, consumers are altering their behaviors
    by seeking local production or bulk buying products. Retailers, as
    boundary spanners between consumers and producers, have a major role
    in initiating change and sustainable development. Part one of this
    book analyzes the sustainable development practices of retailers
    within and between different European countries and presents case
    studies that consider best practices on this topic. Retailer
    include: Carrefour, Casino, Auchan, Leclerc, Intermarché and System
    U in France; Inditex, Cortefiel and MANGO in Spain; Edeka, Rewe,
    Schwarz-Group (with Lidl and Kaufland) and Aldi in Germany; and
    Tesco and Marks & Spencer in UK. International retailers in Poland
    are considered to better understand cross country activities. Part
    two underlines the challenges faced by European retailers in the
    wake of societal and technological changes. The consumers'role and
    their sustainable development practices are analyzed to understand
    the impact on retailing and the main risks for retailers. This book
    will appeal to academics, students and professional educators alike,
    providing a crucial understanding of retailers'practices in
    different countries and their impact on consumers.

*Resource Type:*

*Description:*
    Environmental sustainability practice and research have advanced
    over the past decade from novelty to near-mainstream status today.
    During this environmentally critical time period, sustainability
    practitioner techniques, such as environmental, energy and social
    auditing, other sustainability information and related systems, and
    a wide variety of environmental sustainability approaches have been
    developed, improved and institutionalised, advancing both the
    practice and research of environmental sustainability management and
    policy. However, academics and practitioners in the sustainability
    field still have widely differing perspectives on what a sustainable
    organisation is or might be, but seldom take the opportunity to
    share these respective sustainability visions, let alone the
    multiple ways to achieve them. New Horizons in Research on
    Sustainable Organisations is intended to bridge this gap between
    academics and practitioners with cutting-edge research from both
    groups on progress towards sustainability. After working on
    sustainability-related projects involving other academics, both
    research- and practitioner-oriented graduate students, consultants,
    managers and activists, the lead co-editors of this volume saw the
    need to encourage information exchanges among differing networks of
    sustainability stakeholders to create a pathway for researchers and
    practitioners in the general area of organisations and the natural
    environment to address issues of common interest. There are many
    networks in the general subject area, but the cross-pollination of
    ideas between academics and practitioners remains sketchy. New
    Horizons in Research on Sustainable Organisations is intended to
    present and encourage such cross-pollination. The chapters in this
    volume are presented in three subsets, generally proceeding from the
    most'macro'to the most'micro'in terms of perspective and
    applicability. However, this arbitrary division belies the
    integration from macro through meso (or mid-range) to micro levels
    that is apparent in these studies. Macro approaches typically
    include wider geographic scopes, greater numbers of stakeholders,
    and more complex explanatory factors than micro approaches. Each
    chapter adopts one or more particular sustainability world-view and
    then grounds these and the other chapter elements within actual
    organisations. Therefore, the reader is advised to envision not a
    one-dimensional continuum but rather a circle in which the macro
    view both feeds back and feeds forward to the micro view. This
    volume addresses a number of intriguing and important sustainable
    organisation phenomena such as multiple sustainable development
    perspectives, changing environmental politics, environmental
    management systems variations, voluntary environmental programme
    performance, complex adaptive systems, and environmental technology
    development. Additionally, several models are suggested, such as
    cultivation, capabilities and business ecology frameworks.

*Description:*
    The sustainable development goals (SDGs) were launched in 2015, as a
    global agenda for addressing the multiplicity of social and
    environmental challenges that face communities around the world. But
    what role might entrepreneurship play in reaching these goals? In
    the first book of its kind, Entrepreneurship and the Sustainable
    Development Goals will encourage you to think about the critical
    role that entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs might play in
    supporting sustainable development. More than twenty authors from
    across Africa, Asia, North America, and Europe explore a fascinating
    mix of enterprises and sustainable development initiatives to

*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge, U.K. : Cambridge University Press. 2000
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Demographers predict that world population will double to around
    twelve billion people during the first half of the twenty-first
    century and then begin to level off. Based on this scenario,
    Sustainable Development: The Challenge of Transition examines what
    societal changes must occur over the next generation to ensure a
    successful transition to sustainability within the constraints of
    the natural environment. An array of prominent authors present a
    broad discussion of the dimensions of sustainable development: not
    just economic and environmental, but also spiritual and religious,
    corporate and social, scientific and political. Unlike other books
    on the subject, this volume provides insightful policy
    recommendations about how business, government, and individuals must
    change their values, priorities, and behaviour to meet these
    challenges. This volume will appeal to scholars and decision makers
    interested in global change, environmental policy, population
    growth, and sustainable development, and also to corporate
    environmental managers.

*Publication Information:*
    New York : Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The last decade has seen widespread study of the relationship
    between tourism and the environment, given the growing importance of
    this sector in the economic development of many countries and
    regions. The potential of environmental resources as tourist
    resources and the impact of tourism on these resources are an open
    research area and, because of its social and economic impact, arouse
    great interest among social stakeholders. It is necessary to
    understand and measure their mutual influence in order to achieve
    positive mutual links between tourism and the environment,
    developing theoretical models and applications, and analyzing their
    economic and social sustainability. This book is a collection of
    papers addressing the interaction between tourism and the
    environment through several disciplines, a multidisciplinary
    perspective, and different theoretical and methodological
    approaches. The aim of the authors is to present the wide range of
    current research and promote debate and analysis on this research.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are believed to contribute towards
    economic development of host countries through foreign direct
    investment (FDI), which results in poverty alleviation and human
    empowerment through linkages and spillovers with local stakeholders.
    However, earlier research demonstrates that the positive impact of
    FDI is often inconclusive. There is thus a gap in understanding the
    link between the activities of MNEs in developing countries and
    their impact on socio-economic development. This volume reports the
    results of a large international ‘MNEmerge'research project,
    financed by the European Commission, and provides an understanding
    of the impact of MNEs on United Nations Millennium Development Goals
    and successive Sustainable Development Goals in developing countries.

    Corporate Social Entrepreneurship : Integrity Within
*Series:*
    Business, Value Creation, and Society
*Authors:*
    Hemingway, Christine A.
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge : Cambridge University Press. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Business ethics teaching appears to have had little impact,
    particularly in the light of continued malpractice and misdemeanour
    in the form of financial scandals, environmental disasters and
    adverse consequences for communities. This timely book directly
    addresses a central question: is it that the existence of an ethical
    or an unethical climate influences behaviour, or, does the presence
    or absence of a moral character and personal values have the
    greatest influence on behaviour at work? Hemingway proposes four
    modes of individual moral commitment to corporate social
    responsibility (CSR) and sustainability: the Active Corporate Social
    Entrepreneur, the Concealed Corporate Social Entrepreneur, the
    Conformist and the Disassociated. Hemingway posits that the
    Conformists represent the majority of people in organisations,
    adhering to the prevailing ethical climate, whatever that might be.
    However, it is the discovery of the corporate social entrepreneur
    which offers students and scholars a critical, alternative and
    optimistic perspective for the future of ethical business.

    The Age of Sustainable Development
*Authors:*
    Jeffrey D. Sachs
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Columbia University Press. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Jeffrey D. Sachs is one of the world's most perceptive and original
    analysts of global development. In this major new work he presents a
    compelling and practical framework for how global citizens can use a
    holistic way forward to address the seemingly intractable worldwide
    problems of persistent extreme poverty, environmental degradation,
    and political-economic injustice: sustainable development. Sachs
    offers readers, students, activists, environmentalists, and policy
    makers the tools, metrics, and practical pathways they need to
    achieve Sustainable Development Goals. Far more than a rhetorical
    exercise, this book is designed to inform, inspire, and spur action.
    Based on Sachs's twelve years as director of the Earth Institute at
    Columbia University, his thirteen years advising the United Nations
    secretary-general on the Millennium Development Goals, and his
    recent presentation of these ideas in a popular online course, The
    Age of Sustainable Development is a landmark publication and clarion
    call for all who care about our planet and global justice.

    Protecting Our Environment : Lessons From the European Union

    SUNY Series in Global Environmental Policy
*Authors:*
    Janet R. Hunter
    Zachary A. Smith
*Publication Information:*
    Albany : SUNY Press. 2005
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Examines how the European Union has handled environmental protection
    issues.Significant changes in how the world approaches global
    environmental problems have occurred since the late 1970s. Countries
    have become increasingly aware of the “borderless” nature of
    environmental issues, i.e., that production and consumption in one
    country can spill over to affect another country's environment.
    Protecting Our Environment considers the successes that have been
    achieved in the European Union (EU), as well as issues the Union
    still faces regarding the protection of the environment in the
    future. Authors Janet R. Hunter and Zachary A. Smith identify the
    factors that have allowed the EU to form a successful environmental
    regime, including the development of the environmental management
    approach and the principles upon which it is based. They examine in
    detail the challenges that have been encountered in the
    implementation of environmental programs, and the solutions that
    have been developed to address those challenges. Also considered is
    how economic development and environmental protection have been
    reconciled within the EU. By analyzing the successful example of the
    EU, Protecting Our Environment provides a model for a contemporary
    approach to global environmental problems.Janet R. Hunter is Chair
    of Administrative Information Services at Northland Pioneer College.
    Zachary A. Smith is Regents Professor of Political Science at
    Northern Arizona University. He is the author or editor of many
    books, including The Environmental Policy Paradox, Fourth Edition.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Despite sustained economic growth and rapid poverty reductions,
    income inequality remains stubbornly high in many low-income
    developing countries. This pattern is a concern as high levels of
    inequality can impair the sustainability of growth and macroeconomic
    stability, thereby also limiting countries'ability to reach the
    Sustainable Development Goals. This underscores the importance of
    understanding how policies aimed at boosting economic growth affect
    income inequality. Using empirical and modeling techniques, the note
    confirms that macro-structural policies aimed at raising growth
    payoffs in low-income developing countries can have important
    distributional consequences, with the impact dependent on both the
    design of reforms and on country-specific economic characteristics.
    While there is no one-size-fits-all recipe, the note explores how
    governments can address adverse distributional consequences of
    reforms by designing reform packages to make pro-growth policies
    also more inclusive.

*Title:*
    Building a Green Economy : Perspectives From Ecological Economics
*Authors:*
    Robert B. Richardson
*Publication Information:*
    East Lansing : Michigan State University Press. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The first decade of the twenty-first century has been characterized
    by a growing global awareness of the tremendous strains that human
    economic activity place on natural resources and the environment. As
    the world's population increases, so does the demand for energy,
    food, and other resources, which adds to existing stresses on
    ecosystems, with potentially disastrous consequences. Humanity is at
    a crossroads in our pathway to future prosperity, and our next steps
    will impact our long-term sustainability immensely. In this timely
    volume, leading ecological economics scholars offer a variety of
    perspectives on building a green economy. Grounded in a critique of
    conventional thinking about unrestrained economic expansion and the
    costs of environmental degradation, this book presents a roadmap for
    an economy that prioritizes human welfare over consumerism and
    growth. As the authors represented here demonstrate, the objective
    of ecological economics is to address contemporary problems and
    achieve long-term socioeconomic well-being without undermining the
    capacity of the ecosphere. The volume is organized around three
    sections: “Perspectives on a Green Economy,” “Historical and
    Theoretical Perspectives,” and “Applications and Practice.” A rich
    resource in its own right, Building a Green Economy contains the
    most innovative thinking in ecological economics at a critical time
    in the reexamination of the human relationship with the natural world.

*Title:*
    A Safe and Sustainable World : The Promise Of Ecological Design
*Authors:*
    Nancy Jack Todd
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C. : Island Press. 2005
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In the late sixties, as the world was waking to a need for Earth
    Day, a pioneering group founded a small non-profit research and
    education organization they called the New Alchemy Institute. Their
    aim was to explore the ways a safer and more sustainable world could
    be created. In the ensuing years, along with scientists,
    agriculturists, and a host of enthusiastic amateurs and friends,
    they set out to discover new ways that basic human needs--in the
    form of food, shelter, and energy--could be met. A Safe and
    Sustainable World is the story of that journey, as it was and as it
    continues to be. The dynamics and the resilience of the living world
    were the Institute's model and the inspiration for their research.
    Central to their efforts then and now is, along with science, a
    spiritual quest for a more harmonious human role in our planet's
    future. The results of this work have now entered mainstream science
    through the emerging discipline of ecological design. Nancy Jack
    Todd not only relates a fascinating journey from lofty ideals
    through the hard realities encountered in learning how to actually
    grow food, harness the energy of the sun and wind, and design green
    architecture. She also introduces us to some of the heroes and
    mentors who played a vital role in those efforts as well, from
    Buckminster Fuller to Margaret Mead. The early work of the Institute
    culminated in the design and building of two bioshelters--large
    greenhouse-like independent structures called Arks, that provided
    the setting for much of the research to follow. Successfully proving
    through the Institute's designs and investigations that basic land
    sustainability is achievable, John Todd and the author founded a
    second non-profit research group, Ocean Arks International. Here
    they applied the New Alchemy's natural systems thinking to restoring
    polluted waters with the invention and implementation of
    biologically based living technologies called Ecomachines and Pond
    and Lake Restorers. A Safe and Sustainable World demonstrates what
    has and can be done--it also looks to what must be done to integrate
    human ingenuity and the four billion or so years of evolutionary
    intelligence of the natural world into healthy, decentralized,
    locally dreams hard won--and hope.

    Biodiversity, Sustainability and Human Communities : Protecting
    Beyond the Protected
*Authors:*
    Stoll-Kleemann, Susanne
    O'Riordan, Timothy
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge, UK : Cambridge University Press. 2002
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Biodiversity is the key indicator of a healthy planet and healthy
    society. Losses of biodiversity have now become widespread and
    current rates are potentially catastrophic for species and habitat
    integrity. Biodiversity, Sustainability and Human Communities
    advocates both the preservation of the best remaining habitats and
    the enhancement of new biodiverse habitats to ensure that they cope
    with human impact, climate change and alien species invasion. The
    authors argue that these aims can be achieved by a mix of strict
    protection, inclusive involvement of people inside and adjacent to
    reserves, and by combining livelihoods and social well-being in all
    future biodiversity management. Case studies from regions around the
    world, including Europe, the United States, Latin America and Africa
    are examined and discussed, and the contributors include political
    scientists, economists and ecologists.

    Forest Governance and Sustainable Resource Management
*Authors:*
    Irshad A. Khan
*Publication Information:*
    New Delhi, India : Sage Publications Pvt. Ltd. 2019
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Forest Governance and Sustainable Resource Management vividly
    presents the current state of management and governance of forests
    and other natural resources in India. It focuses on the substantial
    underperformance and need to ensure effective implementation of the
    national forest policy to arrest further depletion of India's
    rapidly declining forest cover. The book extensively covers the
    history of forestry in India, the various forest policies, the legal
    and management frameworks, the various international conventions and
    protocols for dealing with climate change and how effective forest
    management can enable their implementation. It recommends various
    strategic, implementational and governance reforms to deal
    effectively with the current situation. A highlight of this book is
    its extensive coverage of the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation
    and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+), a climate
    change mitigation solution adopted by the United Nations, and
    India's state of readiness in implementing it. The book suggests
    that foresters need to overcome their siege mentality and instead
    work towards empowering themselves to play a more proactive role in
    saving India's forest resources.

*Publication Information:*
    Washington : Island Press. 2006
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    How do you measure biodiversity, and why should landscape architects
    and planners care? What are the essential issues, the clearest
    terminology, and the most effective methods for biodiversity
    planning and design? How can they play a role in biodiversity
    conservation in a manner compatible with other goals? These are
    critical questions that Jack Ahern, Elizabeth Leduc, and Mary Lee
    York answer in this timely and useful book. Real-world case studies
    showcase biodiversity protection and restoration projects, both
    large and small, across the U.S.: the Woodland Park Zoo in
    Seattle,Washington; the Crosswinds Marsh Wetlands Mitigation Project
    in Wayne County, Michigan; the Florida Statewide Greenway System;
    and the Fort Devens Stormwater Project in Ayer, Massachusetts. Ahern
    shows how an interdisciplinary approach led by planners and
    designers with conservation biologists, restoration ecologists, and
    natural and social scientists can yield successful results and
    sustainable practices. Minimizing habitat loss and degradation-the
    principal causes of biodiversity decline-are at the heart of the
    planning and design processes and provide landscape architects and
    planners a chance to achieve their professional goals while taking a
    leading role in the environmental community.

    ‘Bottom-up’ Approaches in Governance and Adaptation for Sustainable
    Development : Case Studies From India and Bangladesh
*Authors:*
    Pradip Swarnakar
    Stephen Zavestoski
    Binay Kumar Pattnaik
*Publication Information:*
    New Delhi, India : Sage Publications Pvt. Ltd. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book analyzes how governance and climate change adaptation -
    both integral to sustainable development - operate outside the
    bureaucratic apparatus of the state. It examines ‘top-down'and
    ‘bottom-up'approaches to sustainable development and looks at a
    possible ‘middle-out'approach to resolving the challenges to
    sustainable development. The book also includes case studies from
    India and Bangladesh, which show that community-level factors such
    as social and cultural capital are key to the success of sustainable
    development efforts.

*Publication Information:*
    Aldershot, England : Routledge. 2006
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Bringing together case studies from Europe, Africa and North and
    South America, this book makes a fresh assessment of the role of the
    individual and the state in land development. It discusses a range
    of issues related to land reform, land development and land
    management, providing a unique reflection of the current state of
    research. Particular emphasis is laid on the implementation of
    sustainable processes of land development as an integrated principle
    of land management. The book examines the rights of the land users
    and addresses a number of issues relating to sustainability and land
    development, ranging from emerging land markets and environmental
    issues, through to natural resource development. The case studies
    provide practical examples of the application of land reform and
    land development to land management.

*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge, Mass : Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. 2011
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Regional planners in the twenty-first century will need to
    understand local issues in a regional and global context. They must
    be adept at defining planning regions based on functional planning
    problems; capable of reaching across boundaries to assess, identify,
    and act on common cause; and able to navigate the currents of power
    to create the lasting relationships and institutions needed to
    implement plans. Regional planning practices can address challenges
    urban and rural communities face achieving sustainability through
    green regionalism.The editors of the volume call for a region ethic”
    that will advance the sustainability of the regions on which our
    existence will depend. The region ethic is a call to recognize the
    central interdependencies that make our inhabitation of cities and
    landscapes possible. This book seeks to assist a new generation of
    practitioners in understanding the roots, underpinnings, and
    applications of regional planning in America today, and the
    prospects for its practice in the future.

    Scarcity and Growth Revisited : Natural Resources and the
    Environment in the New Millenium
*Authors:*
    R. David Professor Simpson
    Michael A. Professor Toman
    Robert U. Professor Ayres
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, DC : Routledge. 2005
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In this volume, a group of distinguished international scholars
    provides a fresh investigation of the most fundamental issues
    involved in our dependence on natural resources. In Scarcity and
    Growth (RFF, 1963) and Scarcity and Growth Reconsidered (RFF, 1979),
    researchers considered the long-term implications of resource
    scarcity for economic growth and human well-being. Scarcity and
    Growth Revisited examines these implications with 25 years of new
    learning and experience. It finds that concerns about resource
    scarcity have changed in essential ways. In contrast with the
    earlier preoccupation with the adequacy of fuel, mineral, and
    agricultural resources and the efficiency by which they are
    allocated, the greatest concern today is about the Earth‘s limited
    capacity to handle the environmental consequences of resource
    extraction and use. Opinion among scholars is divided on the ability
    of technological innovation to ameliorate this'new
    scarcity.'However, even the book‘s more optimistic authors agree
    that the problems will not be successfully overcome without
    significant advances in the legal, financial, and other social
    institutions that protect the environment and support technical
    innovation. Scarcity and Growth Revisited incorporates expert
    perspectives from the physical and life sciences, as well as
    economics. It includes issues confronting the developing world as
    well as industrialized societies. The book begins with a review of
    the debate about scarcity and economic growth and a review of
    current assessments of natural resource availability and
    consumption. The twelve chapters that follow provide an accessible,
    lively, and authoritative update to an enduring-but changing-debate.

*Description:*
    In September 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were
    adopted at the United Nations Development Summit to serve as a
    15-year plan of action for all countries and people. The SDGs
    include 17 specific goals, and 169 associated targets that set out
    quantitative objectives across the social, economic, and
    environmental dimensions of sustainable development, all to be
    achieved by 2030. Health has been recognized as crucial for
    sustainable human development and an essential contributor to the
    economic growth of society. Beyond the goal to â€œensure healthy
    lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages,â€ many of the
    other SDGs include targets that are essential to address the
    environmental and social determinants of health. Considering this
    context, the Forum on Publicâ€'Private Partnerships for Global
    Health and Safety convened a workshop series to examine potential
    opportunities to engage the private sector and develop partnerships
    to advance health and the SDGs. This publication summarizes the
    presentations and discussions from the workshop series.

*Publication Information:*
    Newcastle upon Tyne, UK : Cambridge Scholars Publishing. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This work offers a cross-analysis of the development of tourism in
    Bali, combining international and intercultural (from Indonesian,
    French, Australian and English researchers), transdisciplinary and
    inter-generational research. It questions the capacity of tourism,
    to be a vector of sustainable development, by analyzing its various
    social, economic and environmental effects within Balinese society.
    As such, it represents not only a great research tool, but a
    fantastic teaching aid. Each chapter comes with its own
    bibliography, and thus acts as a standalone case study, while making
    a contribution to the overall thrust of the book.

*Description:*
    'Canada is one of the most beautiful, varied, and inspiring natural
    environments on earth. Few countries contain such topographical
    differences as the West Coast, the mountain regions, the prairies,
    the Arctic, the cityscapes close to the American border, and the
    eastern forests. The Canadian territory is the second largest in the
    world, and it borders on three oceans--its fourth border is with the
    United States, the most powerful economy in the world. This provides
    Canadians unique access to a large market, but also raises many
    problems related not only to political and cultural influence, but
    to transborder pollution. This book investigates the complexities of
    Canadian environmental policy. The text is split into three
    sections: the political context in which decisions are made; issue
    areas in need of engagement; and perspectives on the achievement of
    sustainable development, which colour the Canadian conceptual
    landscape. The first section outlines the state of the Canadian
    environment, the actors and institutions involved in environmental
    policy formation (and a detailed history of Environment Canada), and
    the international context of modern decision-making. The second
    section is issue-specific, including chapters on environmental law,
    risk management and environmental impact assessment, international
    treaties and conventions involving Canada, and an overall assessment
    of Canadian policy. The final section deals with values and
    theories, from gender issues to environmental ethics. The book
    serves as a comprehensive introduction that makes explicit
    recognition of the transnational character of environmental policy
    formation in the era of globalization, and offers critical insights
    into the decision-making process.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The 21st century qualifies as one in which humanity raised
    environmental decay, especially climate change, as a key global
    concern requiring urgent political attention. The book Framework and
    Tools for Environmental Management in Africa is written from this
    perspective. It provides researchers from different disciplines
    including environmental sciences, engineering, commerce, planning,
    education, agriculture and law, as well as NGOs, government
    officials, policy makers and researchers, with a platform to engage
    with concerns relating to sustainable environmental management in
    this epoch. Topics covered include global landmarks for
    environmental governance, environmental management on African
    agenda, sustainability reporting, environmental impact assessment
    and public participation as well as environmental education. These
    remain viable in the African set-up where major development projects
    in mining and agriculture require greater scrutiny. With a
    collection of both revision and critical reflection questions,
    carefully constructed by authors with significant experiences from
    institutions of higher learning across Africa, readers will find
    this publication a valuable addition to their shelves.

*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, South Yorkshire [England] : Routledge. 2002
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Despite the Doha declaration of November 2001, the failure to start
    a new round of global trade negotiations at Seattle in December 1999
    and the hostility of protesters to the trade liberalization process
    and growing global economic and social disparities was a wake-up
    call for the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The ambitious goal of
    this ground-breaking book is to identify the strengths and
    weaknesses of liberalized world trade, in particular in the
    agricultural sector, and to investigate to what extent the current
    WTO agreements provide the necessary fail-safe devices to react to
    trade-related negative impacts on sustainability, environmental
    protection and food security. The background and interrelationship
    between the WTO, the tenets of sustainable development and the
    unique features of the agriculture and forestry sectors are
    explored, and conclusions regarding the deficits of the world trade
    system and its conflicts with basic societal goals – such as
    sustainability – are drawn. Agriculture and forestry have a
    particular affinity with what the authors call'strong
    sustainability'and are to be among the major agenda items in
    forthcoming WTO negotiations. The book proposes that sustainable
    agricultural production techniques such as integrated and organic
    farming provide a series of related services to community and
    environment which could be severely prejudiced by wholesale trade
    liberalization and the imposition of the large-scale production
    methods of the mega-trade giants of the USA and Europe. And yet the
    concept of sustainability is referred to only tangentially in the
    existing WTO agenda. The WTO, Agriculture and Sustainable
    Development argues that, without a formal recognition of this
    failing, the premise that free trade is inherently advantageous for
    all countries is a falsehood. Further, unfettered liberalization is
    unsustainable and a social and environmental multilateral framework
    must be agreed to reinterpret or adapt a host of WTO regulations
    that are at odds with sustainable development. The core problem is
    that, under the current system, import duties can only be
    differentiated by direct goods and services and not by their means
    of production – sustainable or otherwise. Therefore, a range of
    environmental policy measures in the agricultural sector, such as
    the consideration of product life-cycles, the internalization of
    external costs and a coupling of trade liberalization with
    ecological obligations are proposed by the authors. In addition,
    they argue that unsustainable economic short-termism must be curbed
    and the use of the stick of trade sanctions and the carrot of
    financial benefits for good environmental performance be permitted
    to promote sustainable agricultural practices. This book will
    contribute greatly in addressing the lack of basic theoretical
    arguments at the intersection between trade and sustainable
    development – a failing that has already been bemoaned by trade
    policy-makers. It is highly recommended reading for all those
    involved or interested in the WTO negotiations, whether from
    multilateral organizations, governments, industry or civil society.

*Description:*
    Global Education is an area of policy, practice, research and
    educational advocacy. It is an umbrella term that encompasses a
    variety of areas with differing terminologies: development
    education, human rights education, education for sustainable
    development, education for global citizenship. Global Education has
    become increasingly central to education policy and practice.With
    this book GENE – Global Education Network Europe – marks 15 years of
    its work, networking policymakers for increased and improved Global
    Education in Europe. The book explores key issues in contemporary
    Global Education in Europe: issues of national strategy, of
    structure development, of policy learning and engagement within
    education systems. It outlines challenges in research, practice,
    policy and conceptual development, through detailed analysis of
    national and international case studies.The book will be of use to
    policymakers, educationalists, researchers, and practitioners in the
    fields of education, international development, human rights and
    sustainability. GENE intends it as a contribution to the ongoing
    dialogue in this field, towards the day when all people in Europe –
    in solidarity with peoples globally – might have access to quality
    Global Education.

*Description:*
    'Here's a work arriving just at the right moment and contributingnew
    insights at precisely the time when public opinion remains sceptical
    of the not very promising future we are preparing for our children,
    when governments balk at explaining to their electorates the vital
    but unpopular decisions that have to be taken and when civil
    society, with few ways and means, is finally becoming involved. This
    remarkable work will help all actors to understand the
    inter-linkages between economic activities and the environment in
    the Mediterranean Basin and take concerted, effective action to
    build a positive, sustainable future'Mohamed Ennabli, former
    Minister of the Environment and Land Use Panning, Tunisia'The Blue
    Plan has carried out a remarkable assessment of the serious
    environmental probems and insufficiently targeted cooperation in the
    Mediterranean, and also of new financing systems to be implemented,
    which would increase the capacities of local authorities and
    economic and social partners'Georges Corm, former Minister of
    Finance, Lebanon The Mediterranean Basin and its surrounding
    countries is a microcosm of the environmental and sustainability
    challenges facing people across the world. Depending on the
    development path it takes in the future, the region can either
    become a positive model for the regional regulation of
    globalization, or, more onerously, it might reinforce global
    instability. This unique volume is the definitive, authoritative
    assessment of the environment and development of the Mediterranean
    Basin and its 22 countries and territories, spanning five decades
    from 30 years in the past to 20 years into the future. Produced by
    the Blue Plan within the framework of UNEP/Mediterranean Action Plan
    and backed by the EU and national governments, it brings together
    the work of more than 100 researchers from dozens of national,
    regional and local governments and research groups into the only
    comprehensive insight into sustainable development issues in the
    region. Core coverage includes water, energy, transport, cities,
    rural and coastal areas, as well as related issues such as climate
    change, population growth, geopolitical changes, unemployment and
    poverty, pollution, economic and environmental policies, regional
    cooperation and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership. Information is
    clearly presented through hundreds of full-colour maps, graphs,
    tables and a wealth of case studies. This is a must-have reference
    for all levels of government, NGOs and libraries, as well as
    practitioners, academics and businesses involved in economics,
    natural resource management, land and maritime transport, water,
    energy, infrastructure, urban and rural development, agriculture,
    fishing and aquaculture, tourism and coastal management. Countries
    and territories covered: Spain, France, Italy, Monaco, Malta,
    Cyprus, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and
    Montenegro, Albania, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestinian
    Territories, Israel, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.

    Richard A Meganck
    Richard E Saunier
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *2nd ed. London : Routledge. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This unique dictionary and introduction to Global Environmental
    Governance (GEG), written and compiled by two veterans of the
    international stage, provides a compilation of over 5500 terms,
    organizations and acronyms, drawn from hundreds of official sources.
    An introductory essay frames the major issues in GEG and outlines
    the pitfalls of talking past one another when discussing the most
    critical of issues facing the planet. It challenges those who are
    concerned with the management of our planet and its inhabitants to
    understand and accept a vocabulary common to the often-opposing
    objectives sought in the many GEG instruments. The result is a
    practical tool that should find a central place on the desk of
    anyone involved in environmental management, development or
    sustainability issues anywhere in the world, including the United
    Nations, government policy makers, NGOs and other stakeholder
    groups, the business community, and students and professionals. This
    fully revised and updated edition contains over 500 new entries and
    acronyms on global environmental governance as well a new
    introductory section on global water governance, one of the most
    pressing environmental issues in our era of climate change, growing
    populations and food shortages. Praise for the first edition:

    Leon Klinkers
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 1999
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Environmental and social performance measurement and reporting by
    business has become a high-profile issue during the 1990s. It is
    increasingly being requested by stakeholders and required by
    governments. Companies too are finding that they need better
    environmental and social performance data for effective internal
    management. And there are a growing number of standardisation
    initiatives – such as the ISO 14031 guidelines on environmental
    performance evaluation or the CERES Global Reporting Initiative
    (GRI) template for sustainability reporting – that are aimed at
    making it easier for more companies to take action, and for
    stakeholders to compare their progress.Sustainable Measures collects
    together most of the key work and individuals concerned with the
    topic from around the world. Contributions include: environmental
    and social reporting by John Elkington and colleagues at
    SustainAbility; the GRI discussion draft; Roger Adams and Martin
    Houldin on the FEE study of environmental reporting; Janet
    Ranganathan of the World Resources Institute on sustainability
    measures; and Martin Bennett and Peter James on ISO 14031 and the
    future of environmental performance evaluation. There are also
    chapters examining current practice in Austria, Denmark, India,
    Indonesia, Japan, the Netherlands and South Africa, developments in
    electronic reporting, as well as case studies of Baxter, Kunert,
    Niagara Mohawk, Unox, The Body Shop and the UK water industry, and
    an analysis of leading social reports.The book is essential reading
    for all academics, campaigners, policy-makers and practitioners with
    an interest in issues such as:The standardization and comparability
    of environmental and social performance measuresMeasuring and
    reporting on sustainable businessEco-points and other means of
    evaluating product impactsThe implementation of measurement and
    reportingBest practice in corporate environmental and social
    reportingNew means of communicating environmental dataEnvironmental
    performance evaluation in developing countries

*Authors:*
    Dale, Ann
    Onyx, Jenny
*Publication Information:*
    Vancouver, B.C. : UBC Press. 2005
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    A Dynamic Balance illuminates the importance of understanding the
    social dimension of sustainability as it examines the links between
    social capital and sustainable development within the overall
    context of local community development. Looking at case studies in
    both Australia and Canada, it draws upon lessons that can be learned
    to reconnect large urban centres and smaller communities. Given the
    number of small communities in both countries struggling to
    diversify from single-resource economies in a context of increasing
    globalization, the analysis touches on several critical public
    policy issues. This is a timely and provocative call for
    reconciliation and reconnection within and between communities.

    Cleaner Production for Sustainable Development and Safe Future :

*Series:*
    Environmental Science, Engineering and Technology
*Authors:*
    Sinha, Rajiv K.
    Singh, Shweta
    Soni, Brijalkumar K.
*Publication Information:*
    Hauppauge, New York : Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Cleaner production is defined as the continuous application of an
    integrated preventive strategy for environmental protection in the
    developmental processes applied to products and services in
    industries & business organizations to increase overall efficiency
    and reduce risks to humans (consumers and industrial workers) and
    the environment from the hazardous chemicals and materials used in
    the production process. Cleaner production requires applying
    know-how, improving technology and changing attitudes. Since 1950,
    there has been a tremendous increase in the production of diverse
    chemicals to satisfy our demands for consumer goods. According to
    the UNEP, worldwide nearly 80,000 chemicals are used every day and
    about 1500 new chemicals are added every year. A green chemistry
    movement is going on to develop environmentally benign chemicals and
    chemical processes to be applied in chemical industries and
    industries depending on chemicals such as paper, plastic, textile,
    dyeing, printing, photography, agriculture, and electronics. Clean
    air, water and food are the basis of life on earth. Combustion of
    fossil fuels in industries, for power generation and in automobiles
    is the major source (90-95%) of chemical air pollutants and
    greenhouse gas emissions. Promotion of solar, wind, and hydrogen
    fuel technology will completely eliminate them. Chemically grown
    foods by agrochemicals are badly affecting human health. Some 25
    million farmers are poisoned by pesticides, and some 10 to 20
    thousand die every year from this. US scientists predict up to
    20,000 Americans may die of cancer every year, due to low levels of
    residual pesticides in chemically grown foods. Hence, producing
    chemical-free foods by organic farming using biofertilizers and
    biopesticides is the only hope for civilization. Earthworms (Charles
    Darwin's ‘friends of farmers') & its vermicompost (produced from
    Organic wastes) promote high crop growth and also protect from pests
    and diseases. Earthworms can also clean (detoxify and disinfect)
    polluted lands and wastewater. Potable water is a vanishing resource
    on Earth. Since 1950, global water use has more than tripled. Out of
    total water available on Earth, 97.5% is saline. Nearly 2% is frozen
    in polar icecaps & mountains. Only less than 1% of groundwater and
    surface water is usable as potable water. Desalination technology to
    clean seawater into drinkable water is the only hope for
    civilization. Eco-efficiency in use of raw materials, water and
    energy resources is also important because the natural resources of
    Earth are finite, and their demand is getting infinite with an
    increasing population and growing consumerism all over world.
    Eco-efficiency will also reduce waste and pollution, and GHG
    emissions with economic gains for the industries. UNEP has pioneered
    the promotion of cleaner production philosophy. It called for all
    national governments for a long-term action plan to incorporate
    environmental concerns and problems, focusing on cleaner production
    into their educational curricula, especially in engineering and
    business management courses. Additionally, it called for the
    incorporation of developmental policies enacted for industries and
    business organizations. A joint Indo-Australian bilateral meeting on
    a clean development mechanism was organized in New Delhi in 2001.

*Description:*
    Focusing on recent regional policy and important planning debates
    across the English regions, this book analyzes the issues, disputes
    and tensions that have arisen in regional planning in the new
    millennium. With a range of local case studies to ground the
    argument in local as well as regional planning, the authors here
    build on a range of theoretical insights including state theory and
    governance, political ecology, governmentality and collaborative
    planning. Drawing particularly on a discourse approach, the
    empirical sections examine a range of major controversies from the
    past five years of regional planning, including: the socio-political
    resistance to new housing on Greenfield sites alternative approaches
    to promoting sustainable urban development and policies for urban
    renaissance policies on redirecting or constraining economic
    expansion in high-pressure growth areas the social and political
    bases of new planning technologies for protecting the environment,
    including sustainability appraisals.

    Taking Sustainable Cities Seriously : Economic Development, the
    Environment, and Quality of Life in American Cities
*Series:*
    American and Comparative Environmental Policy
*Authors:*
    Kent E. Portney
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge, Mass : The MIT Press. 2003
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Today at least twenty-five major U.S. cities have pursued some form
    of sustainability initiative. Although many case studies
    and'how-to'manuals have been published, there has been little
    systematic comparison of these cities'programs and initiatives. In
    this book Kent Portney lays the theoretical groundwork for research
    on what works and what does not, and why. Distinguishing cities on
    the basis of population characteristics and region for his analysis,
    Portney shows how cities use the broad rubric of sustainability to
    achieve particular political ends. Cities that take sustainability
    seriously, such as Portland, San Francisco, and Seattle, use broad
    definitions that go well beyond concern for the physical environment
    or creating jobs. They pursue sustainability at many levels and
    integrate concern for economic development, the environment, and
    quality of life across all activities of city government. Cities
    that take sustainability less seriously, such as Cleveland, Boston,
    and Orlando, confine it to such issues as solid waste disposal,
    brownfields, redevelopment, and neighborhood beautification. Still
    other cities, such as New Haven, Brownsville, and Milwaukee, do
    considerably less to work toward sustainability. Portney begins by
    reviewing the conceptual underpinnings of sustainable development
    and sustainable communities. The comparisons that follow provide a
    foundation for assessing the range of what is possible and desirable
    for sustainability initiatives. In the book's conclusion, Portney
    assesses the extent to which cities can use the pursuit of
    sustainability either to foster change in public values or merely to
    reinforce values that are already reflected in systems of governance.

*Description:*
    Global environmental change is occurring at a rate faster than
    humans have ever experienced. Climate change and the loss of
    ecosystem services are the two main global environmental crises
    facing us today. As a result, there is a need for better
    understanding of the specific and general resilience of networked
    ecosystems, cities, organisations and institutions to cope with
    change. In this book, an international team of experts provide
    cutting-edge insights into building the resilience and adaptive
    governance of complex social-ecological systems. Through a set of
    case studies, it focuses on the social science dimension of
    ecosystem management in the context of global change, in a move to
    bridge existing gaps between resilience, sustainability and social
    science. Using empirical examples ranging from local to global
    levels, views from a variety of disciplines are integrated to
    provide an essential resource for scholars, policy-makers and
    students, seeking innovative approaches to governance.

    EcoCities : Rebuilding Cities in Balance with Nature (Revised Edition)
*Authors:*
    Richard Register
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *Rev. ed. Gabriola, B.C. : New Society Publishers. 2006
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Most of the world's population now lives in cities. So if we are to
    address the problems of environmental deterioration and peak oil
    adequately, the city has to be a major focus of attention. EcoCities
    is about re-building cities and towns based on ecological principles
    for the long term sustainability, cultural vitality and health of
    the Earth's biosphere. Unique in the literature is the book's
    insight that the form of the city really matters-and that it is
    within our ability to change it, and crucial that we do. Further,
    that the ecocity within its bioregion is comprehensible and do-able,
    and can produce a healthy and potentially happy future. EcoCities
    describes the place of the city in evolution, nature and history. It
    pays special attention to the key question of accessibility and
    transportation, and outlines design principles for the ecocity. The
    reader is encouraged to plunge in to its economics and politics: the
    kinds of businesses, planning and leadership required. The book then
    outlines the tools by which a gradual transition to the ecocity
    could be accomplished. Throughout, this new edition is generously
    illustrated with the author's own inspired visions of what such
    rebuilt cities might actually look like.

    Singapore : World Scientific. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    With more and more of the world's population projected to live in
    urban areas, the life and death of cities has become a key factor in
    urban development considerations. This book attempts to bring an
    original contribution on the analysis of creating living cities. It
    advances the concept and framework of a “living city” and also
    explicates the key attributes of a “living city” that are
    increasingly critical to the reinvigoration and sustainable growth
    of cities.The book also seeks to document and compare Singapore's
    development as a “living city” with other cities around the world.
    Contributed by researchers and practitioners across different
    disciplines, the book provides first-hand insights on the
    development choices that cities can make and expertly draws on case
    studies to illuminate how innovative cities have a comparative
    advantage. Written in a simple and accessible manner, this book will
    appeal to people interested in urban planning, policy and
    sustainability.

    Globalization and the Environment : Greening Global Political Economy
*Series:*
    SUNY Series in Global Politics
*Authors:*
    Gabriela Kutting
*Publication Information:*
    Albany : SUNY Press. 2004
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Examines how globalization and the environment are connected
    issues.This groundbreaking study brings together economic
    globalization and the environment as never before. Gabriela Kütting
    argues for an “eco-holistic” approach that merges social, political,
    economic, and environmental analysis, so that a globalizing
    political economy may be understood in relation to environmental and
    social concerns. Key to this merging are the historical dimension of
    environmental-societal relations, the concept of consumption, and
    the concept of equity. To illustrate the utility of the eco-holistic
    approach, Kütting draws out the linkages between social and
    environmental degradation in West Africa, environmental and economic
    policies in the North, and the shopping habits of individual
    consumers, using cotton agriculture and the globalizing political
    economy of textiles as a case study.Gabriela Kütting is Assistant
    Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University at Newark and
    the author of Environment, Society, and International Relations:
    Towards More Effective International Environmental Agreements.

    Hamburg, Germany : Anchor. 2014
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The survival of man depends on the physical environment. The use of
    the environment has increased in order to satisfy the needs of men.
    Therefore, human negligence and collective actions for economic
    gains have put the environment at a disadvantage.Many of the natural
    ecosystems have been interfered. This has been through encroachment
    on forest reserves, degradation of wetlands, uncontrollable
    expansion of agricultural land leading to soil erosion and soil
    exhaustion, overgrazing and burning of grasslands leading to bear
    soils that are susceptible to erosion agents. A sustainable
    situation occurs when man's ability to use natural resources can be
    replenished naturally. Man's activity has outstretched the ability
    of these resources to replenish naturally. The interactions of man's
    current processes with the environment have strained it. The man's
    disturbance affects the interdependence of the atmosphere that is
    the lithosphere, the hydrosphere and the biosphere which lead to
    environmental degradation.

*Description:*
    Following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, countries took
    up the difficult task of finding a common approach that would slow
    down the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and
    delay changes to the planet's climate. A widespread concern among
    many of the participants in the newly formed United Nations
    Framework Convention on Climate Change was that the emission
    reductions needed to significantly affect climate change would cost
    so much that it could jeopardize the chances of a coordinated
    international solution. To address this concern, several flexible
    mechanisms were designed, including the CDM.While many applaud the
    CDM, others are concerned with its performance and achievements, and
    whether or not it will be continued beyond 2012. Critics argue,
    among other things, that it has not delivered on the sustainable
    development objective for which it was established and that projects
    are unevenly distributed, both geographically and sectorally.Much
    analysis is available on CDM, but very little comprehensive
    analysis, addressing various aspects of CDM is available. With a
    major decision for its continuation, a multi-dimensional analysis
    would be needed. This book is about the economic assessment of
    certain (not certain) CDM performances, and its future
    sustainability and trajectory.

*Title:*
    Growing Smarter : Achieving Livable Communities, Environmental
    Justice, and Regional Equity
*Series:*
    Sustainable Metropolitan Communities Books
*Authors:*
    Robert D. Bullard
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge, Mass : The MIT Press. 2007
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The smart growth movement aims to combat urban and suburban sprawl
    by promoting livable communities based on pedestrian scale, diverse
    populations, and mixed land use. But, as this book documents, smart
    growth has largely failed to address issues of social equity and
    environmental justice. Smart growth sometimes results in
    gentrification and displacement of low- and moderate-income families
    in existing neighborhoods, or transportation policies that isolate
    low-income populations. Growing Smarter is one of the few books to
    view smart growth from an environmental justice perspective,
    examining the effect of the built environment on access to economic
    opportunity and quality of life in American cities and metropolitan
    regions.The contributors to Growing Smarter—urban planners,
    sociologists, economists, educators, lawyers, health professionals,
    and environmentalists—all place equity at the center of their
    analyses of'place, space, and race.'They consider such topics as the
    social and environmental effects of sprawl, the relationship between
    sprawl and concentrated poverty, and community-based regionalism
    that can link cities and suburbs. They examine specific cases that
    illustrate opportunities for integrating environmental justice
    concerns into smart growth efforts, including the dynamics of sprawl
    in a South Carolina county, the debate over the rebuilding of New
    Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and transportation-related
    pollution in Northern Manhattan. Growing Smarter illuminates the
    growing racial and class divisions in metropolitan areas today—and
    suggests workable strategies to address them.

    Human Settlements and Planning for Ecological Sustainability : The

*Authors:*
    Keith Pezzoli
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge, Mass : The MIT Press. 1998
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The heart of the book is the story of what happened when residents
    of Mexico City's Ajusco settlements fought relocation by proposing
    that the areas be transformed into productive ecology
    settlements.foreword by John Friedmann In many areas of the world,
    environmental degradation in and around human settlements is
    undermining prospects for both socioeconomic justice and ecological
    sustainability. To explore the issues involved in this worldwide
    problem, Keith Pezzoli focuses on a dramatic instance of conflict
    that grew out of the unauthorized penetration of human settlements
    into the Ajusco greenbelt zone, a vital part of Mexico City's
    ecological reserve. The Mexican government's initial response to
    these'irregular'human settlements was contradictory and reactive.
    Social unrest, ecological deterioration, and violence have all been
    part of the continuing crisis.The heart of the book is the story of
    what happened when residents of Los Belvederes, a group of Ajusco
    settlements, fought relocation by proposing that Los Belvederes be
    transformed into Colonias Ecolthe bo Productivas, or productive
    ecology settlements. Through innovative organized resistance, their
    grass-roots movement generated environmental and social action that
    eventually won crucial state support. Pezzoli draws upon urban and
    regional planning theory and practice to examine biophysical as well
    as ethical and social sides of the story, and he uses the Mexican
    experience to identify planning strategies to link economy, ecology,
    and community in sustainable development.

    The Natural Step for Communities : How Cities and Towns Can Change
    to Sustainable Practices
*Authors:*
    Sarah James
    Torbjörn Lahti
*Publication Information:*
    Gabriola Island, BC : New Society Publishers. 2004
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Sustainability may seem like one more buzzword, and cities and towns
    like the last places to change, but The Natural Step for Communities
    provides inspiring examples of communities that have made dramatic
    changes toward sustainability, and explains how others can emulate
    their success. Chronicled in the book are towns like Övertorneå,
    whose government operations recently became 100 per cent fossil
    fuel-free, demonstrating that unsustainable municipal practices
    really can be overhauled. Arguing that the process of introducing
    change -- whether converting to renewable energy or designing
    compact development -- is critical to success, the authors outline
    why well-intentioned proposals often fail to win community approval,
    and why an integrated approach -- not'single-issue'initiatives --
    can surmount challenges of conflicting priorities, scarce resources,
    and turf battles. The book first clarifies the concept of
    sustainability, offering guiding principles -- the Natural Step
    framework -- that help identify sustainable action in any area. It
    then introduces the sixty-plus eco-municipalities of Sweden that
    have adopted changes to sustainable practices throughout municipal
    policies and operations. The third section explains how they did it,
    and outlines how other communities in North America and elsewhere
    can do the same. Key to success is a democratic'bottom-up'change
    process, and clear guiding sustainability principles such as the
    Natural Step framework. The book will appeal to both general readers
    wishing to understand better what sustainability means and
    practitioners interested in introducing or expanding sustainable
    development in their communities.

    Sustainable Development or Collapse, Regeneration and

*Description:*
    We are currently confronted with many challenges - poverty,
    migration, environmental issues etc. We can identify at least three
    alternative scenarios of future development: sustainable
    development, sustainable retreat, and/or collapse. During history
    many civilizations went through periods of rise and fall. But
    collapse was usually followed by regeneration and transformation. We
    need to explore our possibilities, how to behave in an era of crisis
    and try to identify in advance contours of regeneration and
    transformation of our society into new quality, new stage of
    development. It would be naive to believe that the 21st century is
    going to be a terrific era of us all entering a consumer paradise.
    It would, however, be equally dangerous to become paralysed with fear.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    When the rivers run dry--water solutions for a thirsty planet. In
    the Age of Scarcity now upon us, fresh water shortages are an
    increasingly serious global problem. With water restrictions
    emerging in many developed countries and water diversions for
    industrial, urban, and environmental reasons stirring up oceans of
    controversy, there is a growing thirst for innovative approaches to
    reducing our water footprint. Dry Run shows the best ways to manage
    scarce water resources and handle upcoming urban water crises.
    Featuring original interviews with more than twenty-five water
    researchers and industry experts, this book explains water issues
    and proposes solutions for homes, buildings, facilities, and
    schools. Examining the vital linkages between water, energy use,
    urban development, and climate change, Dry Run demonstrates best
    practices for achieving “net zero” water use in the built
    environment, including: Water conservation strategies for buildings,
    factories, cities, and Rainwater harvesting Graywater reuse and
    water reclamation systems Water efficiency retrofits On-site sewage
    treatment New water reuse and supply technologies Ideal for
    concerned citizens, building managers, homeowners, architects,
    engineers, developers, and public officials faced with charting a
    course in a more arid future, Dry Run overflows with practical
    solutions. Jerry Yudelson, PE, LEED AP, leads the Yudelson
    Associates consultancy and is a leading authority on green building,
    clean water, and sustainable development. He is the author of eleven
    books, including Choosing Green and Green Building A to Z.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Can good-will be good business? Firms are increasingly called upon
    to address matters such as poverty and human rights violations. The
    demand for corporate social responsibility (CSR) is directed mainly
    at top management in multinational corporations who are reminded
    that, in addition to helping to make the world a better place, their
    commitment to social action will be rewarded by lasting customer
    loyalty and profits. But is it true that firms that engage in social
    action will be rewarded with a good name, competitive advantage,
    superior profits and corporate sustainability? What if it is true
    for some firms and not for others? This book addresses these and
    other questions by explaining the how and why of creating value and
    competitive advantage through corporate social action. It shows how
    and when firms can develop successful corporate social strategies
    that establish strong commitments to shareholders, employees and
    other stakeholders.

    Pathways to Our Sustainable Future : A Global Perspective From
    Pittsburgh
*Series:*

*Authors:*
    Patricia M. DeMarco
*Publication Information:*
    Baltimore, Maryland : University of Pittsburgh Press. 2017
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Pittsburgh has a rich history of social consciousness in calls for
    justice and equity. Today, the movement for more sustainable
    practices is rising in Pittsburgh. Against a backdrop of Marcellus
    shale gas development, initiatives emerge for a sustainable and
    resilient response to the climate change and pollution challenges of
    the twenty-first century. People, institutions, communities and
    corporations in Pittsburgh are leading the way to a more sustainable
    future. Examining the experience of a single city, with all of its
    social and political complexities and long industrial history,
    allows a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities
    inherent in adapting to a changing world. Choices for more
    sustainable pathways for the future include transforming the energy
    system, restoring infertile ground, and preventing pollution through
    green chemistry production. Throughout the book, case studies
    responding to ethical challenges give specific examples of
    successful ways forward. Inspired by Rachel Carson's voice of
    precaution in protecting the Earth, this is a book about empowerment
    and hope.

*Authors:*
    David Waltner-Toews
    James J. Kay
    Nina-Marie E. Lister
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Columbia University Press. 2008
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Is sustainable development a workable solution for today's
    environmental problems? Is it scientifically defensible? Best known
    for applying ecological theory to the engineering problems of
    everyday life, the late scholar James J. Kay was a leader in the
    study of social and ecological complexity and the thermodynamics of
    ecosystems. Drawing from his immensely important work, as well as
    the research of his students and colleagues, The Ecosystem Approach
    is a guide to the aspects of complex systems theories relevant to
    social-ecological management. Advancing a methodology that is rooted
    in good theory and practice, this book features case studies
    conducted in the Arctic and Africa, in Canada and Kathmandu, and in
    the Peruvian Amazon, Chesapeake Bay, and Chennai, India. Applying a
    systems approach to concrete environmental issues, this volume is
    geared toward scientists, engineers, and sustainable development
    scholars and practitioners who are attuned to the ideas of the
    Resilience Alliance-an international group of scientists who take a
    more holistic view of ecology and environmental problem-solving.
    Chapters cover the origins and rebirth of the ecosystem approach in
    ecology; the bridging of science and values; the challenge of
    governance in complex systems; systemic and participatory approaches
    to management; and the place for cultural diversity in the quest for
    global sustainability.

    Eco-efficiency and Beyond : Towards the Sustainable Enterprise
*Authors:*
    Jan-Dirk Seiler-Hausmann
    Christa Liedtke
    Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield : Routledge. 2004
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Business-as-usual, it is widely accepted, will exceed the Earth's
    carrying capacity in an alarmingly short space of time. In simple
    terms, we need to learn to use the world's rapidly depleting
    resources in a significantly more efficient manner. Practical and
    readily adopted solutions are needed now. Eco-efficiency-or'produce
    more with less'– is achieved when goods and services satisfy human
    needs, increase the quality of life at competitive prices and when
    environmental impacts and resource intensity are decreased to a
    degree that keeps them within the limits of Earth's expected
    carrying capacity. Eco-efficiency – a term first proposed by the
    World Business Council for Sustainable Development in 1992 – is a
    management approach that allows businesses to carry out
    environmental protection measures from a market-oriented point of
    view, with the aim of illustrating that ecology and the economy do
    not need to be a contradiction. Indeed, eco-efficiency has been
    portrayed as a win-win-for both business and the environment. This
    book, which developed out of two conferences on eco-efficiency held
    in Düsseldorf in 1998 and 2001, is edited by Ernst Ulrich von
    Weizsäcker and his team from the Wuppertal Institute for Climate,
    Environment and Energy, one of the world's leading research
    programmes on resource productivity. The aim is not simply to
    explain the past and present of eco-efficiency but to look forward
    to and encourage a future where the comprehensive take-up of the
    concept by business, government and consumers could lead to
    innovation on a grand scale and the possibility of a giant leap
    beyond towards overall sustainability. There have been considerable
    achievements to date. The Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which aims
    to list the most sustainable corporations for investors, includes
    companies such as BASF, Climatex, Henkel and Matushita/Panasonic
    (all represented in this book), who are implementing eco-efficiency
    measures. A number of political initiatives have also been formed.
    In December 2001, the German government suggested a National
    Sustainability Strategy to measure Germany's sustainable
    development. While this not yet an accepted political target or even
    law, it shows that politics is moving toward binding targets for
    increasing efficiency. Eco-Efficiency and Beyond collects together
    the leading thinkers on the topic and aims to illustrate not only
    that the concept should be part of every business strategy but that
    it is a key trigger for innovation. Innovation cuts through
    paradoxes. It is the creation of solutions to conflicting demands.
    Flying in a vacuum gave us rockets and satellites; switching
    electrons through insulators gave us Silicon Valley and the digital
    age. Sustainable development presents a similar field of paradoxical
    innovation forces: i.e. provide affordable products and services for
    the growing unmet needs of the world population while reducing
    environmental impacts. This book is the definitive collection on
    eco-efficiency and will be required reading for business,
    government, NGOs and academicians.

    Mining in the Nordic Countries : A Comparative Review of Legislation
    and Taxation
*Series:*
    TemaNord, 2015:542
*Authors:*
    Hojem, Petter
*Publication Information:*
    Copenhagen : Nordic Council of Ministers. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The last few years have seen a lot of activity within the Nordic
    mining industry. New mines have opened, but there have also been
    cases of bankruptcies. Heightened activity has in turn led to
    discussions on the role of legislation and taxation in ensuring that
    mining contributes to sustainable development. At the same time, a
    number of voluntary sustainability initiatives have appeared.For
    historic reasons, the Nordic countries share a lot of similarities
    with regards to legislation. And not least with regards to
    environmental laws, the EU has contributed to further harmonisation,
    even among the non-member states Iceland and Norway. Yet important
    differences exist. Legal revisions are sometimes the result of
    much-publicised problems, so experiences in each country plays an
    important role.An overview of taxation also indicates both
    similarities and differences.

    Educating Activists : Development and Gender in the Making of Modern
    Gandhians
*Authors:*
    Rebecca Klenk
*Publication Information:*
    Lanham, Md : Lexington Books. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    What do people make of their own development? In Educating
    Activists, Rebecca M. Klenk illuminates a reality that is far more
    complex than either development planners or critics commonly assume.
    This gracefully written, accessible ethnography shows how rural
    women accept, refuse, reinterpret, and negotiate development's terms
    in a quest to improve their own communities. Klenk offers an account
    of Lakshmi Ashram, a remarkable Gandhian educational initiative for
    women and girls in Himalayan India. Drawing on extensive fieldwork,
    Educating Activists blends memories and stories with historical
    research and richly detailed ethnographic analysis to craft a
    compelling portrait of how women across two generations have engaged
    with issues of sustainability, poverty, gender equity, autonomy, and
    progress.

    Rebuilding Sustainable Communities After Disasters : Remote Islands
*Authors:*
    Johnston, Ingrid
*Publication Information:*
    Newcastle upon Tyne, UK : Cambridge Scholars Publishing. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    What would you do if a category five monster cyclone was headed your
    way? Drive as far as you could, as quickly as you could in the
    opposite direction? What if there were no cars? What if there were
    no roads? What if you were on a tiny island? What if there was
    nowhere to run to? How would you feel, knowing that when it was over
    it could be weeks before anyone came to help?Thousands of people
    live with this possibility every day, and their resilience and
    coping skills are incredible. However, climate change threatens to
    make these events worse, and all the while the sea levels are
    rising, and these islands are sinking. Bringing together the
    perspectives of the people on small, remote islands in the South
    Pacific, the aid organisations who help after a disaster, and the
    governments, this book investigates how we should respond.These are
    the stories of people for whom climate change is not a theoretical
    future, but a daily reality.

*Description:*
    For more than thirty years, scientists from various disciplines have
    warned that the constant increase in world population and
    exponential world economic growth are seriously threatening our
    ecosystems. The vision on which this book is based is of an ongoing,
    adaptable societal process which leads the world down the path
    towards sustainability. In this vision, the speed of global
    environmental changes will be drastically reduced without forgoing
    the good life; at the same time prosperity will be distributed more
    fairly.

    Metaphors for Change : Partnerships, Tools and Civic Action for
    Sustainability
*Authors:*
    Gee, David
    Bonazzi, Christophe
    Allen, Penny
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 2001
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    How can we get from where we are to where we want to be? Metaphors
    for Change attempts to answer this question and provide a roadmap
    for sustainability by bringing together the thoughts of a unique
    collection of leading change agents from business, government and
    academia. Environmental questions have previously been dealt with
    metaphorically, by catastrophism or manicheism (zero growth;
    Malthusianism, Deep Ecology;'man is the enemy'; less is more). These
    metaphors have had limited impact because they have failed to
    connect with the mainstream of cultural, political, and business
    ideas. This book examines a number of new metaphors – and related
    partnerships, tools and action – which appear to have greater
    possibilities for the world in which we now live. The editors argue
    that Metaphors for Change can deliver to the public and to
    decision-makers new perceptions ('structured knowledge') that can
    help interpret the past and the present, and help us forge the
    future. The wider the gap between the'now'and the'necessary', the
    stronger the bridging perceptions have to be in order to break
    through barriers of fear and conservatism. Some of the concepts
    considered are: sustainable development; the polluter pays
    principle; the precautionary principle; eco-efficiency;
    eco-effectiveness; life-cycle assessment; design for the
    environment; eco-services; dematerialization; industrial symbiosis;
    industrial ecology; and zero emissions. There are of course other
    useful metaphors on the horizon, some of them included in this book.
    Including key contributions from the ground-breaking conferences ECO
    97 and ECO 99, along with other specially commissioned and reprinted
    pieces, Metaphors for Change provides a treasure chest of new ideas,
    innovations and action. Accessible and forward-thinking, it will
    prove indispensable both as a student learning tool and as a
    panoramic overview of the sustainability metaphors key thinkers
    believe we should be putting into practice.

*Publication Information:*

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Many events that have marked the last few years – from the Arab
    Spring revolutions to the different collapses in the financial
    markets in the western world and the Euro Debt Crisis in Europe –
    all share the common issue of “Governance”. The various different
    types of media, especially social media, have contributed to the
    rapid spread of awareness of governance issues, and have enabled
    unprecedented numbers of people to manifest their fury about the
    lack of governance in the management of not only firm and markets,
    but also whole countries and regions. Governance crises were
    previously known mainly in the corporate world, where scandals such
    as Enron and News International have captured the attention of the
    media and have been a major subject of discussion. Such crises have
    recently been transferred to entire nations, where citizens have the
    right to make things change for the best and have the last say.
    People are currently concerned with the establishment of
    accountability mechanisms that were previously absent, as well as
    with real governance reforms that will lead to democracy.This book
    focuses upon governance and on the importance of accountability, and
    how it varies from one environment to another. Also of concern here
    is the effective practice of governance in the shadow of the turmoil
    and unrest, taking into consideration the specificities of each and
    every culture. In adopting such a focus, a number of theoretical
    perspectives are explored, along with issues associated with various
    environments in order to develop an understanding of the
    relationship between governance and sustainable development. The
    book will appeal to academic researchers in the areas of governance,
    sustainable development and corporate social responsibility, as well
    as those interested in strategic management more generally. It will
    be of interest to research students, as well as more experienced
    academics, worldwide, and may also serve as a secondary text for
    courses in these areas.

    Creating Sustainable Communities : Lessons From the Hudson River Region
*Authors:*
    Rik Scarce
*Publication Information:*
    Albany : Excelsior Editions. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Explores efforts aimed at creating sustainable communities
    throughout the Hudson River region.From Mount Marcy to Manhattan and
    beyond, the Hudson River region has become an incubator for rich and
    varied experiments in sustainable living. In this fascinating book,
    Rik Scarce showcases some of these efforts by telling the stories of
    dynamic individuals and organizations that are remaking the region's
    landscape through ecosystem stewardship, nurturing agricultural
    practices, and urban renewal for the twenty-first century, along
    with those promoting creative land-use planning, richly functioning
    communities, and green businesses. Together, their achievements
    point to the potential for other areas of the country to forge
    sustainable futures, and also remind us of the sobering realities
    and daunting challenges that await us as we attempt to remake our
    relationships with the planet and with each other.Rik Scarce is
    Associate Professor of Sociology at Skidmore College and the author
    of Eco-Warriors: Understanding the Radical Environmental Movement.
    He lives in Averill Park, just up the street from the Wynantskill, a
    minor but direct tributary of the Hudson River.

    Design Appraisal and Management of Sustainable Development Projects

    Makati City, Metro Manila, Phillippines : Asian Institute of
    Management. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The management of projects is a subject of significant importance.
    The total amount of the global economy spent on projects has been
    estimated at a staggering $16 trillion. The future needs especially
    for infrastructure development in emerging economies is huge.
    Careful project preparation in advance of expenditure is essential
    to ensure the efficient use of scarce resources. After more than six
    decades of development assistance, most developing economies still
    lack the capacity to prepare sound projects. Despite the large
    volume of existing literature on project management, the current
    books on public sector project management are narrowly focused and
    are few and far between. Moreover, they are theoretical and
    difficult to use for practitioners. This book will fill an important
    lacuna in providing a comprehensive project management book for
    development practitioners bereft to the tedious technical
    underpinnings but replete with the essentials. The book is based on
    the hands-on experience of the author. The book is comprehensive and
    covers all facets of the project management cycle. It addresses all
    the contemporary requirements in the preparation and implementation
    of projects. The book is presented in five parts: Projects and
    Development; Project Identification and Design; Project Feasibility
    and Appraisal; Project Implementation and Control; and Project
    Completion and Evaluation. The book presents an A-Z coverage of all
    the relevant topics on project management. The book would be of
    interest to students at undergraduate and postgraduate levels,
    policy-makers and the staff of international organizations and
    agencies. The book would be an ideal reference for development
    practitioners.

    Post-Education-for-All and Sustainable Development Paradigm :
    Structural Changes with Diversifying Actors and Norms
*Series:*
    International Perspectives on Education and Society, volume 29
*Authors:*
    Shoko Yamada
*Publication Information:*
    United Kingdom : Emerald Group Publishing Limited. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    As the target year of achieving Education for All development goals
    approached in 2015, there were discussions about the post-EFA
    agenda, a process parallel to setting the post-Millennium
    Development Goals. This transition should not be understood simply
    as a normative framework. It has coincided with changes in
    structure, actors, modes of interactions, and practices. The
    emergence of new types of donors who used to be recipients of aid is
    changing the landscape of international educational development.
    Transnational networks of civil society actors gained power to set
    the discourse at multiple levels, through their global
    mission-driven and expertise-based advocacy. Advanced communication
    technologies and broader participation increased the amount of ideas
    exchanged, while the global governance structure becomes more
    centralized in its decision making.

    Conservation and Sustainable Development : Linking Practice and Policy

    Davies, Jonathan
    International Development Research Centre (Canada)
*Publication Information:*
    New York [N.Y.] : IDRC. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The links between policy and practice in natural resource management
    are often depicted as a cyclical and rational process. In reality,
    policy making and implementation are often irrational, unpredictable
    and highly political. Many science- and knowledge-based institutions
    undertake rigorous research with the aim of influencing policy, but
    often their influence is much less than intended. Understanding who
    influences policy at different levels and how is crucial to ensure
    that science is deployed most effectively to have an influence on
    conservation and natural resource management. This book presents a
    variety of innovative ways that have been used to influence policy
    processes, from community pressure groups through elected and
    unelected leaders, to scientific discourse at the levels of
    directors of economic planning and conservation. The book analyzes
    experiences from a variety of conservation interventions by the
    International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and other
    agencies, primarily in Eastern Africa, and challenges the notion of
    policy making as a cyclical process. This book elaborates on this
    theme and presents an array of examples of how communities have
    influenced government, through direct lobbying, influence of
    parliamentarians, wielding of science and research, and
    inter-community dialogue, networking and solidarity. The authors
    present a framework for understanding and strategizing such work so
    that other institutions can identify where they can best add value.

*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2000
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    As the tourist industry becomes increasingly important to
    communities around the world, the need to develop tourism in a
    sustainable manner has also become a primary concern. This
    impressive collection of international case studies addresses this
    crucial issue by asking what local communities can contribute to
    sustainable tourism, and what sustainability can offer these local
    communities in return. The role of the community in environmental,
    cultural and economic sustainability is highlighted in an
    extraordinary variety of contexts, ranging from inner-city Edinburgh
    to rural northern Portugal and the beaches of Indonesia.
    Individually, the investigations in this text present a wealth of
    original research and source material, while collectively, they
    illuminate and clarify the term'community'- the meaning of which, it
    is argued, is vital to understanding how sustainable tourism
    development can be implemented in practice.

    Trade in the Service of Sustainable Development : Linking Trade to
    Labour Rights and Environmental Standards
*Authors:*
    Olivier De Schutter
*Publication Information:*
    Oxford : Hart Publishing. 2015
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In the Bretton Woods era, trade liberalization, the improvement of
    labour rights and working conditions, and the strengthening of
    environmental policies, were seen as mutually supportive. But is
    this always true? Can we continue to pretend to protect the rights
    of workers and to improve environmental protection, particularly
    through climate change mitigation strategies, within an agenda
    focused on trade liberalization? Is it credible to pursue trade
    policies that aim to expand the volumes of trade, without linking
    such policies to labour and environmental standards, seen
    as'non-trade'concerns? This book asks these questions, offering a
    detailed analysis of whether linkage is desirable and legally
    acceptable under the disciplines of the World Trade Organization
    (WTO). It concludes that trade can work for sustainable development,
    but only if we see it as a means for social and environmental
    progress, including climate change mitigation, and if we avoid
    fetichizing it as an end to be pursued for its own sake.

*Description:*
    Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development in
    Emerging Economies is an anthology of seven case studies plus two
    theoretical chapters in a comparative context. It analyzes issues
    related to the rise of multinational corporations, their immense
    economic and political influence in a globalized world, and their
    social responsibility/corporate citizenship. Corporate social
    responsibility is closely examined in terms of meeting the
    challenges of the widening gap between rich and poor, relationships
    with sovereign states, environmental degradation, exploitation of
    natural resources, labor practices, and human rights issues in
    societies in which multinational corporations operate. Are these
    corporations exempt from social roles and accountable to only their
    shareholders (the minimalist position propounded by economists such
    as Milton Friedman), or do they also have ethical and social
    responsibilities to participate in improving the quality of human
    lives in impoverished societies in Africa, Asia and Latin America?

*Authors:*
    Duncan McGregor
    David Simon
*Publication Information:*
    London : Routledge. 2006
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Peri-urban interfaces - the zones where urban and rural areas meet -
    suffer from the greatest problems to humans caused by rapid
    urbanization, including intense pressures on resources, slum
    formation, lack of adequate services such as water and sanitation,
    poor planning and degradation of farmland. These areas, home to
    hundreds of millions of people, face unique problems and need
    distinctive and innovative approaches and solutions. This book,
    authored by top researchers and practitioners, covers the full
    breadth and depth of the impacts of rapid urbanization on
    livelihoods, poverty and resources in the peri-urban zones in
    diverse African, Asian, Latin American and Caribbean contexts.
    Topics include peri-urban resource sustainability, ecosystems and
    societies and environmental changes in peri-urban zones. Rich case
    studies cover production systems and livelihoods including the
    impacts of irrigated vegetable production, horticulture, dairy
    enterprises, waste-fed fisheries and pastoral livelihoods. Also
    addressed are planning and development issues in the peri-urban
    interface including the difficulty in achieving sustainability,
    conflict and cooperation over resources, and a fresh look at the
    relationship between people and their environment. The final part of
    the book presents policies and strategies for promoting and
    measuring sustainability in peri-urban zones including
    community-based waste management, the co-management of watersheds
    and empowerment of the poor. This book is the most comprehensive
    examination of the challenges and solutions facing the people and
    environments of peri-urban zones and is essential reading for all
    practitioners, students and academics in geography and development.

    A Computable General Equilibrium Model for Environmental Policy
    Analysis : The Case of Deforestation in the Philippines
*Authors:*
    Stenberg, Luz Centeno
    Siriwardana, Mahinda
*Publication Information:*
    New York : Nova Science Publishers, Inc. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The deterioration of forest resources and poor economic performance
    in the Philippines calls for a serious rethinking in economic
    policies addressing both environmental and economic objectives. In
    order to protect the Philippine forests, the government implemented
    the Master Plan for Forestry Development covering a 25-year period
    (i.e. 1991-2015). However, after 16 years of implementation, the
    Philippine forestry industry has experienced a further reduction in
    production and in areas devoted to old-growth forests. The annual
    allowable cut remains excessive as it was prior to 1990. This proves
    to be an important forestry policy instrument as the findings in
    this book suggest that the volume of timber or the rate of
    deforestation is directly affected by the annual allowable cut
    rather than by population growth and poverty. The recent economic
    literature suggests the possibility of attaining both macroeconomic
    growth and sustainability in natural resource use. To examine the
    economy-wide effects of the Master Plan and the plausibility of
    attaining sustainable growth, a computable general equilibrium (CGE)
    model is developed with an appended forestry sub-model adopted from
    Dee (1991). The research found that given steady-state in forestry,
    the Dee model can serve as a simple representation of forest growth.
    However, in the context of positive environmental services and
    non-steady state growth in forestry, the Dee model might be
    inappropriate. Given the present land use arrangements in the
    Philippines, the book suggests that the country will meet both
    objectives of growth and conservation via a combination of a
    reduction in forestry discount rate and a uniform reduction in
    sectoral tariffs. Despite the positive effect of uniform tariff
    reduction on gross domestic product, employment in some sectors is
    negatively affected particularly that of farmers, fishers and
    foresters. This indicates the significance of reforestation as an
    employment generation tool, notwithstanding its benefits towards
    resource and soil conservation. In general, forest conservation can
    be achieved with minimal economic sacrifice. Therefore, depending on
    the capability of the Philippine government to enforce land use
    policies, a direct set-aside program (national parks) and the
    implementation of selective logging programs can assist in the
    regeneration and perpetuation of the Philippine forest. The aim of
    the book is to illustrate the application of computable general
    equilibrium (CGE) models in analysing environmental issues,
    specifically deforestation in countries with limited access to
    primary/secondary data. It is an outcome of a government funded
    research project on deforestation in developing economies. We hope
    that this book will appeal to policy makers, politicians, academics,
    government officials especially in developing countries,
    post-graduate students interested in applied general equilibrium
    research and the like. The book brings into light a state-of-the-art
    CGE model with empirical applications into forestry policies in a
    developing Asian economy. Hence the analytical methodology and the
    empirical policy analysis have a greater applicability to many
    countries in Asia and beyond where deforestation has become a
    critical dynamic issue. This book can also be used as a textbook, in
    advanced courses in economic modeling at graduate level in universities.

    Yellow River, The: Water And Life
*Authors:*
    Tetsuya Kusuda
*Publication Information:*
    Hackensack, NJ : World Scientific. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The Yellow River basin, located in the semi-arid and arid climate
    zones in northern China, is confronted with serious problems of
    water deficit as well as water pollution. Due to increasing
    population, rising living standards, increasing pressure of
    expanding irrigation areas and developing industries in the basin,
    efficient water resource allocation has become a pressing issue. On
    the surface this problem appears domestic, but in reality it is of
    international proportions — it may impact other countries through
    trade. As such, development in the basin is severely curtailed.In
    order to understand and provide a way of thinking about the issues
    pertaining to the current state of water resources in the basin, The
    Yellow River systematically explains the methods of modeling and the
    mechanism of water circulation on each element, while introducing
    several new-age technologies for water-saving. This book also
    presents the cutting-edge research results of a five-year project
    that improved the sustainability in utilizing and controlling water
    in the Yellow River basin.

*Title:*
    CSR for HR : A Necessary Partnership for Advancing Responsible
    Business Practices
*Authors:*
    Cohen, Elaine
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 2010
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Arguably, the Human Resources (HR) function is the key partner in
    embedding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Sustainability
    initiatives in any organisation, as this can be achieved only when a
    company educates, engages and empowers its entire workforce. This
    book goes even further and proposes that the HR function has a
    responsibility to be proactive in leading the way in establishing a
    company-wide CSR-enabled culture. And, yet, this is not happening.
    HR managers are preoccupied with their traditional roles of
    organizational development, recruitment, training and compensation,
    and are failing to see the opportunities that CSR brings for them as
    professionals and for their organizations. CSR for HR has been
    designed to change the game. It provides HR managers with a thorough
    understanding of the drivers and principles of CSR and a practical
    step-by-step guide to the way CSR interfaces with every HR function.
    Recruitment, compensation, training, employee communications,
    employee well-being, health & safety, employee rights, involvement
    in the community, and employee impacts on the environment are all
    discussed from the CSR–HR standpoint, with many clear examples
    showing how HR can leverage CSR strategies to deliver greater
    benefit for the business, for employees, for society, for the
    environment and, ultimately, for HR professionals themselves. The HR
    function plays a critical role in embedding a values-based,
    strategic CSR mindset and establishing an organizational culture
    that meets the needs of today's stakeholders. HR professionals who
    understand this and adapt accordingly will reap the benefits. The
    book explains why, how and what to do next, offering detailed
    advice, tools, a roadmap to get started and hundreds of tips from
    companies around the world, including original content from HR
    managers of large corporations. Written from the standpoint of an HR
    professional waking up to the strategic possibilities of
    incorporating CSR in her day-to-day role, the book has an easy and
    engaging style, ideal for the busy managerial reader. CSR for HR is
    both a wake-up call and a toolkit and will be essential reading for
    practitioners in both HR and CSR, as well as being a sought-after
    teaching resource for both executives and students.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In a world where environmental problems spill across political,
    administrative and disciplinary boundaries, there is a pressing need
    for a clear understanding of the kinds of organizations, management
    structures and policy-making approaches required to bring about
    socially equitable and ecologically sustainable development. In this
    second edition, the authors incorporate lessons from a decade of
    work on the conditions of sustainability in both developed and
    developing countries. They prescribe action networks - partnerships
    of flexible, achievement-oriented actors - and present new case
    studies demonstrating the success of organizations that have applied
    this approach. They also introduce case studies on action networks
    that work simultaneously on international, national and local levels.

    Emily Reyna
    Daniel Wang
    Matthew Welch
    Andrew J. Hoffman
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book offers a glimpse into the future. The companies it
    describes are pioneers, the first-movers in market shifts that will
    eventually become mainstream. These'hybrid organizations'– or what
    others call'values-driven'or'mission-driven'organizations – operate
    in the blurry space between the for-profit and non-profit worlds.
    They are redefining their supply chains, their sources of capital,
    their very purpose for being; and in the process they are changing
    the market for others. Using a combination of high-level survey
    analysis and, more importantly, in-depth executive interviews, the
    book helps fill the present gap in literature on environmentally
    focused and financially driven for-profit businesses. Moreover, it
    highlights key trends and critical themes that enable this new wave
    of socially conscious and fiscally minded enterprises to be
    successful in meeting both sets of goals. The takeaway for readers
    of this book is not only an appreciation for common business
    practices that hybrid organizations adopt, but also an understanding
    of the complexity of the integration of such adoption that allows
    them to successfully achieve both mission- and market-driven goals.
    The book begins with key definitions to establish the scope of this
    new sector, including explicit definitions for hybrid organizations,
    environmental sustainability missions, as well as specific criteria
    to create useful boundaries for the field of hybrid organizations.
    Building on prior work conducted by researchers on corporate social
    responsibility, sustainable entrepreneurship, and social enterprise,
    the book catalogues the best practices within this growing sector,
    helping others to learn from both the successes and failures of
    those that are choosing this strategy. The core of the book is built
    on an analysis of survey data from 47 hybrid organizations,
    investigating their business models and strategies, finances,
    organizational structures, processes, metrics, and innovations. The
    organizations represent a cross-section of size, age, industry, and
    geography, although the sample set is biased towards young, small,
    U.S.-based hybrids. Based on analysis of the survey data, five
    best-in-class companies were selected for in-depth case studies in
    order to provide instructive lessons for hybrid practitioners and
    researchers alike. In short, this book presents research that shows
    hybrid organizations to be a practical and feasible organizational
    model for contributing solutions to global environmental issues. The
    lessons in this book will help other social entrepreneurs, business
    managers, non-profit leaders, or students interested in careers that
    fuse profitability and responsibility do it even better.

    Return on Investment in Corporate Responsibility : Measuring the

*Series:*

*Authors:*
    Cesar Saenz
*Publication Information:*
    *Ed.: *First edition. Bingley, UK : Emerald Publishing Limited. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    In today's climate, companies must be economically successful and at
    the same time take social responsibility. Author Cesar Sandro Saenz
    Acosta introduces a new SROIM (Social Return on Investment
    Management) model, to design and measure the social value created by
    companies. SROIM is a framework for tracking, understanding,
    measuring, and reporting the social, economic and environmental
    value created by a project, a program, or a business. This value
    creation can be done: Before the project is initiated During design
    and development, to plan for maximum value. During implementation,
    so that maximum value can be attained. During post-analysis, to

*Title:*
    Towards a Sustainable Information Society : People
*Authors:*
    Ewa Ziemba
*Publication Information:*
    [N.p.] : Cambridge Scholars Publishing. 2016
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This book represents an important voice in the scientific discourse
    on what constitutes a sustainable information society, and provides
    a new comprehensive and forward-looking approach to such a
    development. This approach is based on the adoption of information
    and communication technologies (ICTs) by the main stakeholders of
    society, including individuals, enterprises, and public
    administration, who should use ICTs in order to build the welfare of
    present and future generations, ensure economic growth and
    socio-cultural development, increase participation in public life,
    permit personal development, and build the wisdom of society. As
    such, the book mainly focuses on the role ICTs play in transforming
    business, public administration and everyday life in the context of
    the sustainable information society.This volume will appeal to both
    researchers and practitioners, as it provides significant areas and
    directions for research on the sustainable information society, and
    suggests important issues for programming, building and adopting
    such a society. The book will allow the reader to answer such
    critical contemporary questions as ‘What is the sustainable
    information society and what role is played by ICTs in this
    society?'; ‘What are the challenges and tasks of people,
    enterprises, and public administration that lead towards the
    sustainable information society?'; ‘How can ICTs support people,
    enterprises, and public administration in programming, building and
    adopting such a society?'; ‘What are the factors affecting ICT
    adoption by people, enterprises, and public administration in this
    context?'; ‘What are the areas that should require a primary focus
    in order to achieve the most satisfying results of ICT adoption by
    people, enterprises, and public administration?'; and ‘How can ICT
    adoption by people, enterprises, and public administration be
    measured here?'

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Based on the work of the STELLA (Sustainable Transport in Europe and
    Links and Liaisons with America) Focus Group 3, this volume brings
    together leading transport academics to discuss society behaviour
    and public/private transport. Theoretical and empirical research
    from across North America and Europe form the basis of this book,
    which is composed of twelve chapters that fall into four logical
    sections. Chapters in the first section provide a contextual
    overview and survey trends in mobility behaviour and prospects of
    sustainable transport in the two continents. Chapters in the second
    section provide comparative assessments of difficulties posed by
    contemporary transport systems for three particular user groups
    (low-income, female, and elderly), interventions indicated, and
    research needed. The third set of chapters survey recent
    developments in behavioural modelling that lend themselves to the
    study of the constellation of issues concerning STELLA Focus Group
    3. The remaining chapters of the book address critical issues of
    equity and policy implementation.

    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Due to their specialized training, engineers play a crucial role in
    the design and development of new products and infrastructure, as
    well as in the creation of wealth. Consequently, engineers recognize
    that they have a specific responsibility in the performance of these
    functions to take such measures as are appropriate to safeguard the
    environment, health, safety and well-being of the public. This book
    proposes a series of sixteen practical cases, integrating knowledge
    from different fields of the mechanical engineering discipline,
    along with basic knowledge in environmental, occupational health and
    safety risk management.The case studies provided are descriptions of
    a real system, its functioning and its instructions for use. The
    systems selected represent a broad spectrum of mechanical
    engineering issues and problems, such as fluid mechanics;
    thermodynamics; heat transfer; heating, ventilation and cooling;
    vibrations; dynamics; statics; failure of materials; automatics and
    mechatronics; hydraulics; product design; human factors;
    maintenance; and rapid prototyping, to name a few. The professional
    objective of the examples provided is to design or improve the
    design of the described system. This book is essential in
    transferring knowledge to future engineers with respect to the
    hazards resulting from their work.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    It is difficult to think of a more significant example of
    international cooperation to address a problem that threatened the
    health and wellbeing of the entire planet than the 1987 Montreal
    Protocol for the Elimination of Ozone-Depleting Substances. This
    breakthrough in international environmental governance has proved to
    be an extraordinary success beyond rhetoric or promises. In a dozen
    years, this international agreement went from an understanding of
    the need to act in a precautionary manner for mutual benefit to a
    successful worldwide effort to eliminate chemical substances harmful
    to our protective ozone layer. The production and consumption of
    most ozone-depleting substances has now been phased out in developed
    countries, with developing countries not far behind. What happened
    and why is of tremendous importance for those looking for guidance
    in the future, particularly those now involved in hugely complicated
    negotiations on climate change. The success of the Montreal Protocol
    has been linked to many factors such as political will, treaty
    flexibility and the recognition of equity issues raised by
    developing countries. While comprehensively analysing all of these
    success factors, Ozone Connections goes on to suggest that a social
    organization of global governance as typified by the protocol's
    Technical and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) was a unique – but
    replicable – decisive factor. The book argues that we need to
    understand how the implementation of complex global environmental
    agreements depends on the construction and exploitation of social
    connections among experts who act collectively to define solutions
    to environmental problems. This highly original and provoking thesis
    synthesises some of the more exciting social science concepts and
    methods, while refining our basic understanding of environmental
    social change and providing policy-makers with concrete success
    factors to replicate. This book will be essential reading for
    academics in the fields of sociology, political science,
    international relations, network studies, human communication,
    motivation, collaboration and leadership, as well as the burgeoning
    interdisciplinary field of environmental studies. Businesses will
    also find many applications for practical use. Finally, the many
    directly transferable lessons from ozone layer protection make this
    book a key addition to the growing literature on climate change.

    World Heritage : Benefits Beyond Borders
*Authors:*
    Galla, Amareswar
*Publication Information:*
    Cambridge : Cambridge University Press. 2012
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Published on the 40th anniversary of the World Heritage Convention,
    this thematic collection of case studies provides a thorough
    understanding of World Heritage sites and their Outstanding
    Universal Value in the context of sustainable development. The case
    studies describe twenty-six thematically, typologically and
    regionally diverse World Heritage sites illustrating their benefits
    to local communities and ecosystems and sharing the lessons learned
    with the diverse range of stakeholders involved. The volume
    emphasises a holistic and integrated view of World Heritage, linking
    it to the role local communities play in management and protection,
    and to issues of ecosystem sustainability, and the maintenance of
    biological, linguistic and cultural diversity. Cross-disciplinary in
    its scope, this book will provide a meeting point for researchers,
    practitioners, community representatives and the wider public and
    will promote cultural and natural heritage conservation as a key
    vector of sustainable development and social cohesion.

*Resource Type:*

*Description:*
    This book is the outcome of an international conference held in the
    Department of Economics, Burdwan University, in 2013. The major part
    of the conference had been related to development, environment and
    livelihood issues which are also in some way linked to the theme of
    the ongoing DRS project in the Department, pertaining to issues on
    rural livelihood.The achievement of higher economic growth is one of
    the principal objectives of current government policies, and
    involves intensive resource development programmes with equitable
    access and distribution of output. It is a great challenge for
    developing countries and the only vehicle which can bring these
    countries out of poverty. India's development path is based on its
    unique resource endowments. As a welfare state, its overriding
    priority lies in generating its citizens'wellbeing with the
    multifarious programmes of eradicating poverty through providing
    means of earning income for a sustainable livelihood. While a number
    of programmes have been undertaken by the Government with the aim of
    eliminating poverty, the purpose of generating an all-round enhanced
    livelihood opportunity based on the creation of an improved ambience
    is only partially served by such programmes. The recent focus,
    therefore, has been on the assets/processes/activity framework
    concerned with not only poverty reduction, but also promoting
    sustainable livelihood enhancing strategies and access to assets
    like human capital, physical assets, social capital, financial
    capital and natural capital. In terms of the sustainable livelihood
    framework, livelihood comprises the activities, the assets, the
    capabilities and the access that combine to determine the standard
    of living attainable for an individual. A livelihood is deemed to be
    sustainable when it can absorb unforeseen shocks and recover from
    stresses and uncertainties, while maintaining or enhancing the
    capability and asset base both at present and for future periods
    without distorting the natural resources and creating social unrest.
    This book is composed of seventeen papers covering the socio-
    developmental aspects and natural resources connected with the
    concept of sustainable livelihood, as well as livelihood issues
    intimately linked with the farm and non-farm sectors and impacted by
    gender aspect.

    Africa Through an Economic Lens
*Authors:*
    Amadou Sy
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, D.C. : Brookings Institution Press. 2018
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    A broad vision for economic progress in AfricaA more peaceful and
    prosperous Africa is in everyone's interest. Such an Africa would
    translate into more trade and investment, more jobs, and more
    security for all. Africa is now at a crossroads and the right path,
    if taken, could lead the continent closer to reaching its growth and
    human development objectives. As one banker recently said, it is no
    longer a matter of “Why Africa?” but “How Africa?”Using economic
    policy analysis, this book examines the vision for achieving this
    idea of “How Africa?” through the cooperative actions of the African
    Union, Africa's private sector, civil society, women, and youth. It
    looks at the continent's progress in delivering on this vision,
    specifically its ability and progress in maintaining momentum,
    sharing the benefits of growth, and financing its development. The
    book also looks at risks and opportunities that are part of this
    vision—such as population growth, urbanization, and technological
    changes, and the role that countries such as the United States and
    China, as well as institutional and private sector partners, can
    play in achieving Africa's vision.This book offers a vision of
    Africa that puts together all the pieces of the puzzle to help
    inform policymakers from all disciplines. Policymakers and political
    commentators in the United States and elsewhere typically look at
    Africa through discrete lenses that focus on specific elements of
    what is happening on the continent, from security concerns to trade
    disputes to humanitarian crises. This tendency to focus narrowly,
    however, gives a fragmented and incomplete vision of the continent.
    A broader economic lens helps refocus the vision of Africa and is
    necessary if one wants to have a meaningful impact on policies to
    achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth.The book takes
    care to understand and study the vision that Africans themselves
    have of their continent. It is also forward looking in its focus on
    trends and risks such as population growth, rapid urbanization, and
    technological change.

*Title:*
    The Future of Eco-labelling : Making Environmental Product
    Information Systems Effective
*Authors:*
    Frankl, Paolo
    Rubik, Frieder
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, UK : Routledge. 2005
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Eco-labelling is one of the key tools used by policy-makers in many
    parts of the world to encourage more sustainable production and
    consumption. By providing environmental information on products and
    services, eco-labels address both business users and consumers and
    range from mandatory approaches, such as required product
    declarations, to voluntary approaches, such as national eco-labels.
    Eco-labels can play an important role in environmental policy. They
    reward and promote environmentally superior goods and services and
    offer information on quality and performance with respect to issues
    such as health and energy consumption. Eco-labels fit well into a
    multi-stakeholder policy framework – as promulgated recently by the
    EU's integrated product policy (IPP) – since the development of
    criteria for labels and the acceptance in the market requires the
    involvement of a wide range of different parties, from government
    and business, to consumers and environmental organisations. However,
    many eco-labelling schemes have had troubled histories, and
    questions have been raised about their effectiveness. So, are
    eco-labels an effective tool to foster the development, production,
    sale and use of products and to provide consumers with good
    information about the environmental impacts of those products? Is
    eco-labelling useful to business as a marketing tool? What factors
    contribute to the development of successful schemes? More than ten
    years after its establishment, can the EU Flower be considered a
    success? Are national eco-labels such as the German Blue Angel and
    the Norwegian White Swan more effective? Should eco-labels be
    harmonised? Are eco-labels achieving their original aim of fostering
    sustainable production and consumption? For which product groups are
    ISO type I eco-labels appropriate and inappropriate? Are other
    labels, such as mandatory, ISO type II and ISO type III labels more
    effective in some cases? Are eco-labels focusing on the main
    environmental policy targets or just on'low-hanging fruit'? Are
    eco-labels really linked to other tools of IPP? The Future of
    Eco-labelling provides answers to all of these questions. Based on a
    major EU research exercise, the book plots a course for
    policy-makers to address some of the historic problems with
    eco-labelling, to learn what works and what doesn't and to move
    forward with schemes that can make a real difference to sustainable
    production and consumption.The book analyses the conditions under
    which eco-labelling schemes-both mandatory and voluntary-are or can
    become an efficient and effective tool to achieve given objectives;
    assesses previous experiences with eco-labels in different European
    countries and the relationship of these schemes with business
    strategies, IPP and market conditions; defines strategies aimed at
    linking eco-labels with other IPP measures; explores how eco-labels
    can be used to encourage sustainable consumption patterns, create
    green markets, foster innovation and development of green products
    and services, and implement multi-stakeholder initiatives; and sets
    out detailed recommendations for the future of eco-labelling.The
    book will be required reading for policy-makers, businesses involved
    with eco-labelling schemes and researchers interested in the
    development of sustainable production and consumption and IPP worldwide.

*Description:*
    The Earth's thirsty and burgeoning human population is confronted
    today with the reality of an unchanging freshwater supply-a
    disparity that grows worse each year. Global water usages have
    increased six fold during the last century, and policymakers and
    politicians have met this increasing demand by building larger dams.
    Can these megadams solve chronic water shortages, poverty, and
    future food security? Proponents have argued that bigger dams are
    better; they increase irrigation opportunities, provide water to
    drought-prone areas, reduce flooding, and supply hydropower.
    However, opponents have found that the social costs of displacement
    due to dams are as dramatic as the ecological cost. Evidence from
    semi-arid regions of western India has shown that a more sustainable
    solution may be to build instead numerous check dams-small barriers
    using stones, cement, steel and concrete built across the direction
    of water flow on rivers to harvest rainwater. In this book, the
    author based on his research conducted at the NM Sadguru Water and
    Development Foundation introduces the pressing issues of water
    management in the drylands of India emphasizing sustainable
    development. This monograph highlights a variety of development
    issues involving water resources, lift irrigation, agriculture,
    floriculture, sanitation, renewable energy, and human ecology.
    Therefore this book should serve as an introductory, supplementary
    and reference text for sustainable development, natural resource
    management, ecology, water resource management, agriculture,
    renewable energy, and rural development courses in colleges,
    universities and other institutes of higher learning around the globe.

    technological revolution, the overall roles of regional capitals and
    smart cities, and the role of Russian growth at the regional and
    international level. Looking across modern Russian development and
    growth strategies, constraints, and challenges, these chapters
    follow on from two volumes by the same editor: Exploring the Future
    of Russia's Economy and Markets: Towards Sustainable Economic
    Development (2018), and Modeling Economic Growth in Contemporary
    Russia (2019). Together, the trilogy is essential reading for
    students and researchers of contemporary international economics,

    James Boyce
*Publication Information:*

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Economics for People and the Planet, a collection of essays by James
    K. Boyce on the environment, inequality and the economy, argues that
    there is not an inexorable trade-off between advancing human
    well-being and having a clean and safe environment. The goal of
    economic policy should be to grow the good things that improve our
    well-being and environmental quality and reduce the bad things that
    harm humans and nature. To reorient the economy for these ends, we
    will need to achieve a more egalitarian distribution of wealth and
    power. Global climate change – the most pressing environmental
    challenge of our time – adds urgency to this task and creates
    historic opportunities for moving towards a greener future.

*Description:*
    Shall we produce more or smarter? This study with the title
    `Sustainable Prosperity Through Qualitative Growth – An Economic
    Analysis Using The Example Of China ` analyzes the theoretical
    framework of economic growth and how it leads to sustainable
    prosperity. It propounds the notion of prosperity and sustainable

    subsequently political dimension of economic growth. The found
    insights are applied to the real-life example of the Chinese
    economic development of the past three decades to draw conclusions
    and explain why prosperity can be sustainable and which way leads to
    this goal.

    Living Off-Grid in Wales : Eco-Villages in Policy and Practice
*Authors:*
    Elaine Forde
*Publication Information:*
    Cardiff : University of Wales Press. 2020
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    Living Off-Grid in Wales addresses broad debates about the
    possibility of planning for a sustainable future, by an examination
    of rural development off the grid. Contrasting Wales's policy on One
    Planet Development – a planning policy that encourages living
    off-grid – with a more DIY approach to living off-grid, the book
    presents case studies from eco-villages that imagine off-grid very
    differently. The text pivots on the problematic question that if
    planning is about the spatial reproduction of society, then why
    should it encourage autonomy from societal systems. The ethnographic
    case studies in the book comprise an ethnography of rural Wales, and
    the focus on eco-villages brings a fresh perspective to the
    anthropological literature on community by considering off-grid as a
    radical form of social assemblage.

    The Ecology of the New Economy : Sustainable Transformation of
    Global Information, Communications and Electronics Industries
*Authors:*
    Jacob Park
    Nigel Roome
*Publication Information:*
    Sheffield, U.K. : Routledge. 2002
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    A'revolution'is taking place in the development of global
    information and communications technologies. In slightly more than a
    decade, the World Wide Web has gone from the idea of an obscure
    English scientist to a consumer-oriented technology system with an
    expected one billion users by 2005. The technologies that enable
    this to happen are advancing rapidly, which is leading to both an
    unprecedented number of start-up companies and a host of innovative
    new alliances between companies. The growth has been so rapid and
    unexpected that little research and analysis has yet been done on
    what impact this transformation has had or will have on the ability
    of companies to meet the global sustainability challenge. As
    environmental strategy has traditionally been portrayed in terms of
    risk cutting and resource efficiency, there is a danger that
    critical business issues such as information technology, R&D and
    e-commerce development are examined in isolation from the wider
    sustainable business perspective. An important objective of the book
    is to explore, document and raise awareness of sustainability
    concerns arising from the emerging global information economy. The
    information economy is defined in the broadest sense possible,
    including software, hardware, telecommunication – traditional and
    wireless – and advanced communication technologies. Some of the key
    issues and questions that are examined include:Case studies on how
    and to what degree sustainability concerns are being integrated into
    the business model of electronic, telecommunication and dot.com
    firms. The relationship between the diffusion of information and
    communication technologies and the energy and resource intensity of
    companies. The role of information and communication technologies in
    the shaping of policies for sustainability, its impacts on
    sustainable or unsustainable lifestyles and its implications for the
    interaction between companies and other actors. Corporations and the
    global digital divide. The Ecology of the New Economy will be of
    interest to academics, governments, businesses, and non-governmental
    groups who are trying to understand the linkages and relationship
    between the two of our greatest global challenges: the information
    revolution and environmental sustainability.

    Tyndall Centre
*Publication Information:*
    Hoboken : Routledge. 2013
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    This special issue of the Climate Policy journal addresses the
    following key questions: • What long-term range of policies for
    climate change adaptation and mitigation should Europe pursue to
    adequately enhance sustainability on a global level? • What are the
    implications of long-term European climate strategy for the design
    of a global post-2012 climate regime? • What are the key concerns of
    different stakeholders and how will these concerns impact on
    long-term climate policy? These questions were discussed during two
    workshops, commissioned by the European Forum on Integrated
    Environmental Assessment (EFIEA) and jointly organized by the
    National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), The
    Netherlands and the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, UK.
    Selected papers from these workshops were adapted and peer-reviewed
    for publication. International experts offer detailed policy
    analysis and review the links between policy and economics,
    sustainable development, technology and adaptation. Also included
    are introductory and concluding remarks from the guest editors,
    highlighting key points and offering an expert synthesis of the
    workshop discussions. This will be invaluable reading for
    professionals, researchers and academics interested in climate
    change and climate policy, policy makers, policy analysts, energy
    consultants, and representatives from industry planning their own
    long-term energy strategies.

*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The most adequate tool of synthesis of the heterogeneous notions,
    concepts and methods is their mathematical formalization which
    provides a common language of the description and analysis. That is
    the reason why the concept of sustainable management is presented in
    this book on the base of mathematical modeling. Applied mathematics
    must use mathematical models and methods of their analysis for
    description of real systems and processes and connected practical
    problems. The results of an applied mathematical research lie beyond
    mathematics and belong in this case to the problems of sustainable
    management. The main value of the strict statements received by
    means of applied mathematics lies in the possibility of their
    interpretation and consequent usage in applied domains.

    Megaregions : Planning for Global Competitiveness
*Authors:*
    Catherine Ross
*Publication Information:*
    Washington, DC : Island Press. 2009
*Resource Type:*
    eBook. 
*Description:*
    The concept of “the city” —as well as “the state” and “the nation
    state” —is passé, agree contributors to this insightful book. The
    new scale for considering economic strength and growth opportunities
    is “the megaregion,” a network of metropolitan centers and their
    surrounding areas that are spatially and functionally linked through
    environmental, economic, and infrastructure interactions. Recently a
    great deal of attention has been focused on the emergence of the
    European Union and on European spatial planning, which has boosted
    the region's competitiveness. Megaregions applies these emerging
    concepts in an American context. It addresses critical questions for
    our future: What are the spatial implications of local, regional,
    national, and global trends within the context of sustainability,
    economic competitiveness, and social equity? How can we address
    housing, transportation, and infrastructure needs in growing
    megaregions? How can we develop and implement the policy changes
    necessary to make viable, livable megaregions? By the year 2050,
    megaregions will contain two-thirds of the U.S. population. Given
    the projected growth of the U.S. population and the accompanying
    geographic changes, this forward-looking book argues that U.S.
    planners and policymakers must examine and implement the megaregion
    as a new and appropriate framework. Contributors, all of whom are
    leaders in their academic and professional specialties, address the
    most critical issues confronting the U.S. over the next fifty years.
    At the same time, they examine ways in which the idea of megaregions
    might help address our concerns about equity, the economy, and the
    environment. Together, these essays define the theoretical,
    analytical, and operational underpinnings of a new structure that
    could respond to the anticipated upheavals in U.S. population and
    living patterns.

*Description:*
    Sustainable Development Goal 4 seeks to'Ensure inclusive and
    equitable quality education for all and promote lifelong learning
    opportunities for all.'It acknowledges that quality education is a
    foundational necessity for sustainable development and an enhanced
    quality of life. SDG4 - Quality Education: Inclusivity, Equity and
    Lifelong Learning For All explores the multifaceted and complex
    nature of the concepts of inclusivity and quality education. Drawing
    examples from two different country contexts (Latvia and Jamaica),
    the book explores how and why inclusive and quality education is
    critical to sustainable development. It considers the indicators of
    inclusive and quality education, how the concept of education for
    sustainable development is evolving, and the ways in which these
    indicators are being pursued. The book pays specific attention to
    the roles of teachers, teacher educators, and the curriculum in the
    attainment of inclusive and quality education and 21st Century
    skills for a sustainable society. Concise Guides to the United
    Nations Sustainable Development Goals comprises 17 short books, each
    examining one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The series
    provides an integrated assessment of the SDGs from economic, legal,
    social, environmental and cultural perspectives.

*Description:*
    For many decades the international community has endeavoured to
    eliminate extreme poverty; however, it is estimated that around 800
    million people still live below the international poverty line of
    $1.90 a day. This book looks this global problem and presents
    applicable solutions to show that we can eliminate poverty today and
    meet the challenge of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 1. The
    first part of the book discusses what poverty and development are
    and asks whether the right to development is an international
    commitment to eradicate poverty. The second part looks at the
    strategy of the Sustainable Development Goals, and the concept of
    happiness for all people in the world. It examines the proposition
    of SDG1, evaluates the first actions taken in this area, and
    presents the best practice of recent SDG implementation. The final
    part considers several proposals and presents suggestions on how to
    make global action more effective. Concise Guides to the United
    Nations Sustainable Development Goals comprises 17 short books, each
    examining one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The series
    provides an integrated assessment of the SDGs from economic, legal,
    social, environmental and cultural perspectives.
